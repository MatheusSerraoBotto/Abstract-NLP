"The Psychophysiology of Political Ideology: Replications, Reanalyses, and Recommendations","This article presents a large-scale, empirical evaluation of the psychophysiological correlates of political ideology and, in particular, the claim that conservatives react with higher levels of electrodermal activity to threatening stimuli than liberals. We (1) conduct two large replications of this claim, using locally representative samples of Danes and Americans; (2) reanalyze all published studies and evaluate their reliability and validity; and (3) test several features to enhance the validity of psychophysiological measures and offer a number of recommendations. Overall, we find little empirical support for the claim. This is caused by significant reliability and validity problems related to measuring threat sensitivity using electrodermal activity. When assessed reliably, electrodermal activity in the replications and published studies captures individual differences in the physiological changes associated with attention shifts, which are unrelated to ideology. In contrast to psychophysiological reactions, self-reported emotional reactions to threatening stimuli are reliably associated with ideology."
"Disparities in a Flagship Political Science Journal? Analyzing Publication Patterns in the Journal of Politics, 1939–2019","This article adds to ongoing discussions about the gender gap in political science publishing. Through a systematic examination of 80 years worth of data, I show how evolving trends in authorship and coauthorship have changed the nature of publishing in the Journal of Politics. I build on previous studies by incorporating into this analysis a decade’s worth of submission data provided to me by the journal. Second, I use a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to identify how the content of published articles has shifted in recent decades. I describe how these moves have affected the publication prospects of both men and women. Although progress has been made, the balance of evidence suggests that there remains unevenness in terms of both who and what is published in the pages of the Journal of Politics."
Gendered Political Contexts: The Gender Gap in Political Knowledge,"What explains the gender gap in political knowledge found by surveys across different contexts? This article proposes that female political representation affects the levels of knowledge expressed by men and women and, ultimately, the gender gap. The underrepresentation of women makes gender stereotypes salient, and these in turn affect how much cognitive effort individuals put into thinking about politics. Moreover, I argue that surveys are often responsible for enhancing the effect of those considerations. I analyze cross-national survey data from 120 countries to test whether the gap in knowledge decreases as female representation increases across countries. Then, I manipulate the gender composition of feeling thermometer batteries in a survey experiment with American subjects to test whether priming considerations about female representation affects respondents’ performance on knowledge questions. The findings suggest an explanation for why surveys often reveal gender differences in knowledge and a mechanism connecting women’s representation and public opinion."
"Self-Confidence and Gender Gaps in Political Interest, Attention, and Efficacy","Compared to men, women are less interested in politics, less likely to follow current events, and more pessimistic about their abilities to be influential in politics. I explore the origins of these gender gaps. I argue that feelings of self-confidence serve as a resource that encourages psychological engagement with politics. But because this resource is more likely to be possessed by men than by women, it contributes to gender gaps in political interest, attention to politics, and internal efficacy. By examining surveys of both young people and adults, I demonstrate that gender’s effects on psychological engagement with politics are partially mediated by feelings of self-confidence. While prior studies emphasize the importance of resources like education for cultivating political engagement, I show that self-confidence is an important psychological asset that promotes political interest, attention, and feelings of personal competence in politics."
Adam Smith on Political Judgment: Revisiting the Political Theory of the Wealth of Nations,"How should the ordinary citizens of commercial societies navigate increasingly complex political landscapes characterized by global markets, specialization, and manipulation by special interests? In this article, I refer to the gap between the demands of political judgment and the capacities of ordinary citizens as the “political judgment problem,” and I argue, drawing on Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, that versions of this problem have existed since the early days of commercial society. By reconstructing Smith’s account of collective action by ordinary citizens, we can better understand the importance of political judgment to Smith’s political theory. Attending to it uncovers both classical solutions to the political judgment problem and a series of underappreciated modern answers focused on lowering the cognitive burdens of political judgment such as creating alternatives to partisan cues in public deliberation, reforming ideological shortcuts, and simplifying the multidimensional political space."
Signaling Sophistication: How Social Expectations Can Increase Political Information Acquisition,"Information plays an integral role in theories of political behavior. However, little is known about why—if ever—voters choose to acquire political information. This article proposes that voters strategically acquire costly political information to cultivate a reputation among their peers as politically sophisticated. I test this theory in Mexico using experimental and observational research designs that exogenously vary the likelihood that individuals’ peers observe the political knowledge they possess. The results demonstrate that social incentives significantly increase political knowledge among voters nested within groups that collectively value political knowledge. Consistent with the model, I find that relatively unsophisticated voters seek to reach a minimum standard within their social group, while more sophisticated voters acquire higher levels of information to differentiate themselves from less informed peers. These findings indicate that social networks can increase informed participation in a major nonconsolidated democracy, but they also highlight how politically disengaged networks can generate information traps."
Does Homeownership Influence Political Behavior? Evidence from Administrative Data,"We combine deed-level data on homeownership with administrative data on voter turnout in local and national elections for more than 18 million individuals in Ohio and North Carolina. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that buying a home leads individuals to participate substantially more in local elections, on average. We also collect data on local ballot initiatives, and we find that the homeowner turnout boost is almost twice as large in times and places where zoning issues are on the ballot. In addition, the effect of homeownership increases with the price of the home purchase, suggesting that asset investment may be an important mechanism for the participatory effects. Overall, the results suggest that individual economic circumstances importantly influence political beliefs and behavior and suggest that homeowners have special influence in American politics in part because their ownership motivates them to pay attention and participate."
How Dispositional Empathy Influences Political Ambition,"Political representation is fundamentally about advancing the needs and interests of others. Empathy—the ability to share others’ feelings and perspectives—ought to be a critical skill for effective representation. Yet the conflict, negativity, and competition that are endemic to politics may prevent empathetic individuals from seeking office. Using an original national survey with an oversample of people who have run for office, we explore how citizens’ dispositional empathy influences political ambition. We show that perspective-taking increases ambition, while personal distress depresses ambition. By analyzing feelings toward several different aspects of running for and holding political office, we show the mechanisms through which empathy affects ambition. Finally, we demonstrate that experimentally manipulated perceptions of campaign context moderate the effects of empathy on ambition. Our results provide new insight into how psychological factors interact with political context to shape ambition and hold important implications for the quality of representation."
The Gendered Effects of Violence on Political Engagement,"How does civil conflict affect political engagement? As violence of various forms—from war to terrorism—is becoming more frequent even in the developed world, understanding its political consequences is a pressing concern. We argue that violence makes citizens view politics as more combative and aggressive. Because the traits that align with these perceptions (e.g., dominance, aggressiveness, decisiveness) are associated more with masculinity than femininity, we hypothesize that violence increases engagement among men while reducing it among women. To test our argument, we conduct an experiment in Bosnia (N=1,125), the site of a major ethnic civil war in 1992–95. The evidence confirms that past violence, when made salient, leads women to express significantly less and men significantly more desire to engage in politics. We conclude from these findings that violent conflict can introduce disparities in political engagement across gender, underscoring a significant challenge policy makers face in postconflict societies."
The Continuity of Ethics and Political Theory,"What is the relationship between ethics and political theory? In particular, is the study of interpersonal and social morality continuous with inquiry into how we should lead our political lives? This article evaluates the call for firmer boundaries between moral and political thought that is central to recent realist critiques of analytical political theory. I identify, and reject, three versions of this position, which I term “discontinuity realism.” My critique draws attention to an important silence within discontinuity realism, concerning how its call to address politics from within relates to the feminist insight that politics is deeply intertwined with our personal choices and interpersonal relationships. The article goes on to defend an alternative “continuity” approach to the study of ethics and political theory. This approach better realizes the realist’s own aspiration for greater sensitivity to empirical detail in normative political theory."
Electoral Protests and Political Attitudes under Electoral Authoritarianism,"Do opposition protests affect citizens’ attitudes in electoral autocracies? While existing research expects that as protests unfold in illiberal regimes support for the protesters will increase, there are only a few empirical tests of this hypothesis. Combining an original author-assembled protest event data set with two nationally representative public opinion surveys that were in the field during the 2011–12 electoral protests in Russia, we examine whether and how protests affect political attitudes. We find that, in the early weeks of the protest wave, opposition rallies generated support for the demands of the protest movement. Nevertheless, evidence also suggests that the effects of protests on attitudes are not uniform. The coverage of protests in national media, and the use of regime-led repression against protesters, dampen support for the protest movement and its demands. Our findings make an original contribution to scholarship on authoritarian vulnerability and resilience to street discontent."
Can Political Alignment Be Costly?,"Research on the benefits of political alignment suggests that voters who elect governing party politicians are better off than those who elect other politicians. We examine this claim with regression discontinuity designs that isolate the effect of electing a governing party politician on an important publicly provided service in Pakistan: health. Consistent with existing research, governing party constituents receive a higher quantity of services; more doctors are assigned to work in governing party areas. However, despite many more assigned doctors, there is no increase in doctor attendance. These findings contrast with the literature on political alignment by showing that alignment to the governing party affects voters’ welfare ambiguously: higher potential quantity of services may come at the cost of lower quality."
The Effective Altruist’s Political Problem,"Critics of private charity often claim that the well-off should instead assist the disadvantaged through political reform. The present article explores this idea with reference to effective altruism, a powerful new paradigm in the ethics of philanthropy. Effective altruism presses the relatively affluent not only to give generously, but also to subject their practical deliberations to rigorous evaluations of impartiality and cost-effectiveness. The article contends that the movement’s sophisticated methods are not sufficient to overcome the worries of institutionalist critics. At the same time, it shows that a transition from assistance to advocacy faces underappreciated and serious limitations. The measurement-based methods that allow effective altruists to identify promising assistance programs do not carry over well to political reform. In addition, unleashing greater private wealth into politics may exacerbate unequal opportunities for political influence. The article closes with preliminary suggestions for overcoming these concerns and connects them to broader developments in the politics of philanthropy."
Information Technology and Political Engagement: Mixed Evidence from Uganda,"This study integrates three related field experiments to learn about how information communications technology (ICT) innovations can affect who communicates with politicians. We implemented a nationwide experiment in Uganda following a smaller-scale framed field experiment that suggested that ICTs can lead to significant “flattening”: marginalized populations used short message service (SMS) based communication at relatively higher rates compared to existing political communication channels. We find no evidence for these effects in the national experiment. Instead, participation rates are extremely low, and marginalized populations engage at especially low rates. We examine possible reasons for these differences between the more controlled and the scaled-up experiments. The evidence suggests that even when citizens have issues they want to raise, technological fixes to communication deficits can be easily undercut by structural weaknesses in political systems."
Age of Marriage and Women’s Political Engagement: Evidence from India,"Although decades have passed since most women in the democratic world gained the right to vote and run for election, a large gender gap in political participation persists, particularly in developing countries. This short article considers an important—and previously overlooked—factor limiting the political engagement of many women in the developing world: marriage age. Drawing on nationally representative data from India and instrumenting marriage age with menarche age, we find that delaying marriage has substantial positive effects on women’s everyday political participation. A standard deviation increase in marriage age makes a woman 25% more likely to attend local council meetings and 8% more likely to discuss politics with her husband. Exploring mechanisms, we show that education and time—rather than employment, mobility, and household decision-making power—appear to be the main channels. These findings underscore the critical role of early marriage in impeding women’s participation in the political sphere."
Do Women Pay a Higher Price for Power? Gender Bias in Political Violence in Sweden,"Violence and intimidation against politicians is gaining attention in research on obstacles to political gender equality, but we still do not know whether women experience more violence as politicians than men. This article provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of physical and psychological gender-based violence against officeholders across the political hierarchy. Based on three waves of survey data on 8,000 local-level politicians in Sweden, I find that the most pronounced gender gap in violence exists among politicians high in the political hierarchy. Female mayors experience far more violence than any other politician. Further, there are indications that women receive a higher penalty than men for media visibility and for supporting minorities. This suggests that perpetrators of political violence are biased toward targeting women, particularly more powerful and visible women. The findings have important implications for understanding the personal price paid for holding positions of political power and how it differs by gender."
"Boycotting, Buycotting, and the Psychology of Political Consumerism","Political consumerism refers to the intentional avoidance or purchase of products because of political, social, or ethical concerns. The intentional avoidance (boycotting) and the intentional purchase (buycotting) of products constitute a growing form of political behavior. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework for understanding and disentangling boycotting and buycotting, based on a psychological framework of avoidance and approach, respectively. We conduct three original survey experiments to identify the differential effects of negative and positive information in stimulating boycotting and buycotting behaviors. In all three studies, we find that negative information is far more powerful in inducing boycotting than positive information is in inducing buycotting."
The Political Logic of Government Disclosure: Evidence from Information Requests in Mexico,"When citizens ask questions, how does their government answer? Requests for government information confront officials with incentives both for and against disclosure. We argue that officials seek to manage political risks in ways that favor requests from government-aligned regions. We study responsiveness in the context of Mexico’s access-to-information law, using publicly available data from several hundred thousand information requests filed with Mexican federal government agencies between 2003 and 2015. Our empirical strategy makes comparisons only among requests sent to similar agencies on similar topics at similar times, while accounting for the complexity, sophistication, and sensitivity of individual requests. We find that requests filed from locales with higher governing-party vote shares receive more favorable responses, across multiple indicators of the nature and timing of responses. Further, we find bias only for requests on publicly relevant topics, providing evidence in favor of a mechanism of mitigating political risks over one of rewarding supporters with greater access to benefits."
"Culture, Capital, and the Political Economy Gender Gap: Evidence from Meghalaya’s Matrilineal Tribes","What explains the gender gap in political engagement and economic policy preferences? Many scholars point to material resources, while others credit cultural determinants. We identify and test an important link between these factors: cultural lineage norms that structure entitlements to resources. Studying the relationship between culture and resources is challenging in societies where both disadvantage women. We analyze a unique setting: northeast India, where matrilineal tribes live alongside patrilineal communities. Patriarchal cultures and political institutions are shared, but lineage norms are distinct: patrilineal groups distribute inherited wealth through men, while matrilineal tribes do so via women. We conduct survey and behavioral experiments with representative samples of both communities, alongside extensive qualitative research, and find that the gender gap reverses across patrilineal and matrilineal groups. Our results indicate that lineage norms—which determine who gets to make decisions about wealth and how—are key determinants of the political economy gender gap."
Deadly Populism: How Local Political Outsiders Drive Duterte’s War on Drugs in the Philippines,"Around the world, populists have won elections on the strength of crowd-pleasing, but norm-defying, policy proposals. Although effective at mobilizing support at election time, these policies are often difficult to implement in practice because populists lack allies throughout the political system. Examining President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal War on Drugs in the Philippines, we find that mayors excluded from existing establishment patronage networks filled this critical implementation gap. Employing regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences approaches, we demonstrate that outsider mayors received 40% lower public works appropriations and, in turn, executed Duterte’s drug war much more aggressively. Outsider-led municipalities had 40% more antidrug incidents and 60% more extrajudicial killings by police. The results illustrate an important trade-off between patronage politics and corruption (politics as usual) and violent democratic backsliding."
How Does Economic Knowledge Have a Politics? On the Frustrated Attempts of John K. Galbraith and Robert M. Solow to Fix the Political Meaning of Economic Models in The Public Interest,"In the late 1960s, two big shots of postwar economics debated model-building techniques in the Public Interest. Robert M. Solow argued that the new methods enabled precise state intervention. To John K. Galbraith, they marginalized critical economic thinking and abetted the prevailing growthist ideology to the detriment of the public good. Both claimed influence over policy making but through different channels. Both argued vigorously to fix the political meaning of modeling before a general audience. This article focuses on the actors’ frustrated attempts to establish clear-cut relationships between research practices, modes of intervention, and political ideals. Despite their strenuous exertions, they did not succeed in equipping their competing methodological stances with equally distinct politics. Where these efforts failed, they resorted to constructions of scientific self and other. Personae glued together practices (including assumptions, tools, and standards of evidence) and politics where perhaps no inherent bond existed. Our reading (1) elucidates the confusion over mathematical models just as they became the objects of political debate, and (2) aims to confound the idea that there is a politics of knowledge that is clearly delineable and transparent to historical actors and retrospective observers alike."
The Political and the Epistemic in the Twentieth Century: Historical Perspectives,"Historical studies on the relationship between knowledge and politics have mostly focused on the narrower interplay between scientific knowledge and political institutions: the role of experts and advisors in policy making or the impact of the modern state on scientific institutions, theories, practices, and projects. Borrowing from Foucauldian discourse analysis, others have departed from the constitutive interrelationship between knowledge and power in order to reconstruct the epistemic regimes of governmentality. Taking up recent accounts in political theory, such as those by Jacques Rancière, Ernesto Laclau, and Chantal Mouffe, we argue for an antifoundationalist understanding of both the political and the epistemic beyond institutionalized frameworks. The distinction between science, knowledge, and the realm of the political is thus not imbued with a clear-cut dividing line; instead, the relationship is characterized by ongoing and contested boundary work performed by various actors with different resources, strategies, intentions, and interests. The historically shifting scope of the political relies on contested fields and foundations of knowledge, and vice versa. For a more thorough understanding of the political aspects of knowledge production and circulation we therefore suggest considering the nonfoundational and agonistic conditions in which knowledge emerges in an ever-changing power play of forms and social contexts."
Political Instability and the Failure of Deterrence,"To study the conceptual foundations of deterrence, we develop a model of an international crisis between a country seeking to maintain a peaceful status quo (Defender), and a potential aggressor (Attacker). Attacker’s leader is politically insecure and may be unseated by domestic elites. Leaders and elites can each be hawkish, benefiting from conflict, or dovish and prefer peace. We show that the ability to maintain peace through deterrence crucially depends on ideological cohesiveness within Attacker countries. When there is ideological disagreement, we identify two novel mechanisms that cause the conventional logic of deterrence to fail. First, political instability breaks the link between a leader’s aggressive actions and Defender’s retaliatory response. Second, political instability creates a commitment problem leading doves to initiate crises to quell domestic conflicts. Asymmetric information exacerbates these problems so severely that Defender is better off committing to complete inaction."
"Political Booms, Financial Crises","Political booms, measured by the rise in governments’ popularity, predict financial crises above and beyond better known early warning indicators, such as credit booms. This predictive power, however, only holds in emerging economies. We argue that governments in developing countries have stronger incentives to “ride” unsound credit booms in order to boost their popularity, rather than implementing corrective policies that could prevent crises but are politically costly. We provide evidence of the relevance of this mechanism, partly by constructing a new cross-country data set on government popularity based on opinion polls."
The Strategic Foundations of Political Sovereignty,"Maintaining order is perhaps the most important problem confronting society, and establishing a sovereign ruler with monopoly control over the execution of violence creates two distinct security problems: one between private citizens (the horizontal dimension) and the other between the ruler and private citizens (the vertical dimension). I develop a framework to study these dual security problems and the incentives created in solving them together. I show that self-enforcing political sovereignty presents a problem of reciprocal agency, where every individual is simultaneously a principal and an agent and that a ruler will extort rents in exchange for upholding the social contract—the social contract tax—which crucially relies on balancing two distinct incentives, the desire to predate and the opportunity cost of political order. I consider the problem of selecting a ruler and show that the citizen who extorts the least is either the richest or the poorest, depending on the level of economic inequality."
Party Systems and Political Centralization and Decentralization,"Using a comprehensive, global data set, we provide evidence toward settling a debate in the literature on party systems and national political institutions regarding the relationships between political centralization and nationalization of political party support. We also help explain disparate findings in the literature. Does political centralization or decentralization precede nationalization or regionalization of political party support, or the other way around? We confirm previous findings that centralization is correlated with nationalized party systems. Our analysis shows, however, that on average centralization precedes party system nationalization more often than the other way around. And specifically, we provide novel evidence that it is administrative centralization, and not fiscal centralization, that drives these changes. The findings, based on a variety of statistical specifications and measures, are important because they shed light on the way that institutional changes, including constitutional changes regarding the relationships between central governments and subnational governments, affect party competition."
Violence against Women in Politics: Latin America in an Era of Backlash,"Violence against women in politics is increasingly recognized as a problem for women’s political participation worldwide. At the same time, antiprogressive campaigns promoted by religious groups and populist governments have risen across the globe. Looking at several cases in Latin America, I explore the differences and similarities between violence against women in politics and backlash, arguing that while they may be interrelated or concurrent, there are important differences between the goals, perpetrators, and forms of these two phenomena. While violence against women in politics is directed at women as women, backlash is directed at particular policies that, in the view of backlashers, upend a social order based on the heterosexual and patriarchal family. Ending both violence against women in politics and backlash requires structural and cultural changes, but each requires distinctive techniques. On the one hand, institutional changes that disincentivize violence against women in politics and provide effective reporting mechanisms will reduce the effects of this form of violence. Combatting backlash, on the other hand, requires strong and autonomous civil society organizations, mobilized grassroots movements, and political alliances between these actors to create effective pressure for resisting regressive policies. Both violence against women in politics and backlash pose important challenges for democracy worldwide, and combating them is imperative."
Race and Southern Political Development,"This article argues that ethnographic methods, or an ethnographic sensibility more broadly speaking, can go some way to addressing a thorny issue of realism in political theory. Realists are committed to taking context seriously and to offering critique, but how can they do both? Based on a reconstruction of the main lines of inquiry and arguments of Bernardo Zacka’s When the State Meets the Street, the article shows that an ethnographic sensibility is well suited to address the realist predicament because it combines two levels of interpretation. On one level, it seeks to reconstruct people’s understanding of what they are doing and who they are. On a second level, ethnography seeks to interpret the larger ideational and material power relations that affect people’s values and practices. The essay spells out how taking an ethnographic sensibility can enhance (realist) political theorists’ understanding of the nature and limits of politics in a particular context, while at the same time providing a starting point for potentially transformative criticism from within this context."
"Realism in Political Theory, Ethnographic Sensibility, and the Moral Agency of Bureaucrats","While scholars often portray Chinese political thought and tradition as standing in opposition to Western notions of political liberalism, little consideration has been given to compatibility between liberalism and Daoism, a prominent religion and long-standing alternative school of thought among Chinese peoples. Addressing this gap in the literature, this study in comparative political thought compares Laozi’s Dao De Jing with John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty to illustrate certain core political ideas in the Dao De Jing and their treatment in Mill’s landmark text on political liberalism. Although the two texts diverge in terms of advocacy of popular representation, public contestation, and legal rights, both reject authoritarianism, uniformity, patriarchy, censorship, harm, violence, and wastefulness. A reasonable interpretation of these affinities is that a unique, indigenous, and non-Western model of liberalism existed in China via Laozi’s thought for centuries before the advent of modern Western liberalism."
"The Other China Model: Daoism, Pluralism, and Political Liberalism","Using an original data set of around 70,000 civil rights cases heard by nearly 200 judges, we study the effect of presidential appointments to federal district courts. We provide the first causal estimates of whether lawsuits end differently depending on their assignment to either a Democratic or a Republican appointed judge. We show Republican appointees cause fewer settlements and more dismissals, favoring defendants by around 5 percentage points. We estimate a similarly sized effect for a sample of civil rights appeals heard in the Ninth Circuit, raising questions about the conventional wisdom that politics matters more at higher levels of the judicial hierarchy. We also find that the effect in district courts has increased over time. For cases filed during the Obama presidency, Republican appointees caused pro-defendant outcomes in 7.4% more cases than Democratic appointees. Our results suggest that district courts are an important—although neglected—subject of research for political scientists."
Political Appointments and Outcomes in Federal District Courts,"Do policy makers in both parties represent the opinions of the richest Americans, ignoring those of median income? We find that the two political parties primarily represent different interest group sectors, rather than public economic classes. The Republican Party and business interests are aligned across all issue areas and are more often aligned with the opinions of the richest Americans (especially on economic policy). Democrats more often represent middle class opinions and are uniformly aligned with advocacy groups. Support from both parties is associated with policy adoption, but party influence cannot explain the association between affluent opinions and policy outcomes. Rather than an oligarchic political system, these patterns show competition among organized elites that still provides multiple potential paths for unequal public class influence."
"Political Parties, Interest Groups, and Unequal Class Influence in American Policy","What are the political consequences of negative political theory concepts such as demagoguery? What happens when they are deployed in a way that brands an innocent victim with a reputation he or she does not deserve? This article contends that Daniel Shays was just such a victim. Despite playing only a peripheral role in the erroneously named “Shays’s Rebellion” of 1786–87, Shays himself was singled out by elites looking for ways to deflect blame away from themselves and their oligarchic Massachusetts regime. Subsequently labeling the movement “Shays’s Rebellion,” these elites cemented the narrative that Shays had led protest movements in western Massachusetts. Shays thus entered American political vernacular as the paradigmatic demagogue—and “Shays’s Rebellion” became the example of demagogue-led state failure—through the successful weaponization of a political idea. More broadly, the Shays case functions as a window into the relationship between ideas and political development in American politics."
Creating a Demagogue: The Political Origins of Daniel Shays’s Erroneous Legacy in American Political History,"A striking characteristic of moral judgments is that people commonly assign value to particular actions, irrespective of what consequences the actions bring about. This phenomenon might be important to understanding political judgments, when people frequently purport to stand on principle, even when doing so comes at a substantial cost. Here, I draw on work in psychology that might help identify which citizens are insensitive to consequences in the context of political argumentation. I find that a particular facet of attitude intensity (moral conviction) identifies citizens who think about political issues in absolutist terms (studies 1 and 2) and who dismiss damaging information about policy consequences (studies 3 and 4). These results develop understanding of what attributes make different political arguments compelling to different people and illustrate the utility of attitude intensity measures as a way to account for the atomized and disorganized nature of political opinions."
Actions versus Consequences in Political Arguments: Insights from Moral Psychology,"Individuals vary in how intensely they care about political outcomes. Despite attention to intensity in studies of representation and public opinion, the study of elections has paid less attention to the strategic dynamics of intensity. I present a theory that brings intensity to electoral competition. I investigate the preelection actions of voters and the response of candidates through a game-theoretic model. Because intensity is unobserved and subject to misrepresentation, voters communicate intensity through costly political action. Candidates respond to voter actions by sometimes proposing policy opposed by a low-intensity majority. The theory suggests when and why citizens choose costly action and expression, describes why citizens might prefer candidates with negative traits such as a history of misconduct, indicates when majoritarian systems might implement nonmajoritarian policy, shows when costly political action is welfare enhancing, and might help scholars reason about how candidates learn about voter interests."
"A Theory of Intensity, Electoral Competition, and Costly Political Action","Despite its centrality to human life, health, and happiness, sleep has never been a central topic of concern to political scientists. This article proposes that chronotype (a person’s time-of-sleep preference) is a previously unidentified psychological correlate of political ideology. Chronotype may lead to political ideology through a motivated social cognitive process, ideology may shape sleep patterns through a desire to align with social norms, or ideology and chronotype may arise from common antecedents, such as genetics, socialization, or community influences. Analyses demonstrate a link between a morningness and conservatism in seven American samples and one British sample. This relationship is robust to controls for openness, conscientiousness, and demographics, including age, sex, income, and education. The article concludes with a call to incorporate sleep and chronotype research into political science across a range of topics and subfields, including political psychology, social networks, political geography, political communication, political institutions, and survey design."
"Conservative Larks, Liberal Owls: The Relationship between Chronotype and Political Ideology","Does decentralization affect how voters attribute blame for poor economic performance? This question is particularly important in authoritarian regimes, where economic performance legitimacy is a key source of regime stability. Using political and economic data from large Russian cities for 2003–12, we investigate how replacing direct mayoral elections with appointments affects the way voters attribute blame for economic outcomes. We find that the ruling party is more likely to be punished for poor economic performance in cities with centrally appointed mayors than it is in cities with elected mayors. This research suggests that having locally elected officials may help electoral authoritarian regimes deflect responsibility for some unfavorable outcomes."
Who Is to Blame? Political Centralization and Electoral Punishment under Authoritarianism,"Political contractualism is important in societies characterized by substantial moral and political disagreement and diversity. The very disagreement that makes the social contract necessary, however, also makes agreement difficult. Call this the paradox of diversity, which is the result of a tension between two necessary conditions of political contractualism: existence and stability. The first involves showing the possibility of some agreement, while the second involves showing that the agreement can persist. To solve both of these problems, I develop a multilevel contract theory that I call the “open society” model of political contractualism that incorporates diversity into the contractual model at different levels solving the existence problem, while avoiding fragility in the face of the stability problem. This approach is able to take advantage of the benefits of institutional diversity while providing a stable framework for productive political disagreement."
"Agreeing to Disagree: Diversity, Political Contractualism, and the Open Society","Abul A‘la Maududi (1903–79), the influential Indo-Pakistani Islamist thinker and founder of Jama‘at-e-Islami, was deeply concerned with the dominance of European political ideas on Muslim thought. Showing that Maududi’s critique of nationalism had greater depth and complexity than most commentators have recognized, and taking seriously his stated interest in moving beyond the “intellectual slavery” engendered by colonialism the essay argues for reading his analysis of nationalism in modern democracies and his proposed solution of jizya as an attempt at decolonizing political theory through conceptual innovation that employed Islamic resources to address limitations of European thought and practice, and inverted colonial hierarchies of thought. Recognizing it as such deepens our understanding of the challenges involved in and raised by decolonizing political theory."
Jizya against Nationalism: Abul A‘la Maududi’s Attempt at Decolonizing Political Theory,"This article reveals the positions of corporations not only as active players in politics but also as targets of activist shareholders with opposing political preferences. We examine whether a firm’s political orientation, as measured by its political spending, serves as a driver of shareholder proposal submissions, one manifestation of shareholder activism. Using data on S&P 500 companies for 1997–2014, we find that the divergence in political orientation between shareholders and corporate management is strongly associated with the number of submissions of shareholder proposals on environmental or social issues. Firms that contribute more to the Republican Party are more likely to be targeted by nonindividual, Democratic-leaning shareholders. This pattern remains even after controlling for firms’ records of corporate social responsibility and labor relations. This finding implies that corporate political spending prompts shareholders with strong political preferences to target firms on the opposite end of the political spectrum."
Active Firms and Active Shareholders: Corporate Political Activity and Shareholder Proposals,"Does party competition affect political activism? This paper studies the decision of party supporters to join political campaigns. We present a framework that incorporates supporters’ instrumental and expressive motives and illustrates that party competition can either increase or decrease party activism. To distinguish between these competing predictions, we implemented a field experiment with a European party during a national election. In a seemingly unrelated party survey, we randomly assigned 1,417 party supporters to true information that the canvassing activity of the main competitor party was exceptionally high. Using unobtrusive, real-time data on party supporters’ canvassing behavior, we find that respondents exposed to the high-competition treatment are 30% less likely to go canvassing. To investigate the causal mechanism, we leverage additional survey evidence collected two months after the campaign. Consistent with affective accounts of political activism, we show that increased competition lowered party supporters’ political self-efficacy, which plausibly led them to remain inactive."
Does Party Competition Affect Political Activism?,"The characters and preferences of individual leaders matter greatly for policies and governance in many political systems, yet systematic evidence on how politicians lead and the consequences of their leadership styles remains scant. This study sheds light on these issues by analyzing a unique data set of internal evaluation remarks for top provincial politicians in China. Latent class analyses on evaluation keywords reveal two distinct styles: an assertive, autocratic style that focuses on centralized decision-making and efficient execution and a relatively soft, collegial style that respects dissent and fosters intraelite collaboration. We further show that these two leadership styles are associated with distinct governing strategies and that they both offer viable, but different, paths to political survival. These findings enrich our understanding of survival tactics and selection dynamics in one-party systems."
Leadership Styles and Political Survival of Chinese Communist Party Elites,"As insurgent challengers disrupt parties and party systems across the democratic world, political scientists need to think more systematically about insurgents and the politics they make. In this article, I propose a new framework for understanding electoral insurgents and their systemic impact on politics in two-party systems. Insurgencies vary along dimensions of regime- and party-orientation, and unfold in four distinct patterns: reconstructive, co-optive, reorienting, and reactive. I compare two reconstructive insurgencies in which the structure, rules, and procedures of an existing major party were challenged and reformed during the postwar period: the New Politics movement inside the U.S. Democratic Party and the New Left in the U.K. Labor Party. Given the barriers to third-party success in these party systems, insurgents were successful at transforming parties when they framed their projects as being in line with specific aspects of the postwar political regime at a moment when that order was in crisis. In each case, insurgents had durable effects on party development by institutionalizing a reformist dynamic that has routinely drawn organizational issues into intraparty contests, undermining organizational legitimacy over time. Thinking systematically about the politics that insurgents make offers a new way of understanding the role of movements and entrepreneurs in party development."
The Politics Insurgents Make: Reconstructive Reformers in U.S. and U.K. Postwar Party Development,"Elaborating on the notion of “political economy of life,” first developed in a 2009 book on indigenous forms of slavery and servitude, I argue that the idea that all forms of life share the same reserve of vitality, that such life force is transferable between different kinds of beings, and that vitality is scarce or unevenly distributed, seems to be widespread among native Amazonians. As a result, all living beings—humans, animals, plants, spirits, gods, and even some objects—are engaged in a fierce competition to accumulate as much life force as possible in order to guarantee the survival of their own kind. Through a comparative analysis of six ethnographic “scenes,” I explore what life means to native Amazonians, examine the ontologies and eco-cosmologies that provide the indigenous struggle for vitality with its rationale, and identify the elements that prevent the system from becoming a Hobbesian “war of all against all.”"
Amerindian political economies of life,"While social pressure is widely believed to influence voters, evidence that information passed between social ties affects beliefs, policy preferences, and voting behavior is limited. We investigate whether information about unemployment shocks diffuses through networks of strong and mostly weak social ties and influences voters in Denmark. We link surveys with population-level administrative data that log unemployment shocks afflicting respondents’ familial, vocational, and educational networks. Our results show that the share of second-degree social ties—individuals that voters learn about indirectly—that became unemployed within the last year increases a voter’s perception of national unemployment, self-assessed risk of becoming unemployed, support for unemployment insurance, and voting for left-wing political parties. Voters’ beliefs about national aggregates respond to all shocks similarly, whereas subjective perceptions and preferences respond primarily to unemployment shocks afflicting second-degree ties in similar vocations. This suggests that information diffusion through social ties principally affects political preferences via egotropic—rather than sociotropic—motives."
Diffusing Political Concerns: How Unemployment Information Passed between Social Ties Influences Danish Voters,"For elections to produce accountable government, citizens must reward politicians who deliver benefits. Yet there is relatively limited causal evidence of changes in public opinion in direct response to specific government programs. This question is examined in Tanzania, which has implemented large health programs targeting diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. Tanzania’s 2010–11 antimalaria campaign took place concurrently with a national household survey. Exploiting discontinuities based on interview dates to estimate the effect of these programs on the popularity of local politicians, this article shows that a bed net distribution campaign resulted in large, statistically significant improvements in approval of political leaders, especially in malaria endemic areas. Effects were largest shortly after program implementation but persisted for up to six months. These findings suggest that citizens update their evaluation of politicians in response to programs, especially those that address important problems, and that the effects decay over time, but not completely."
The Impact of Health Programs on Political Opinion: Evidence from Malaria Control in Tanzania,"Political honors are ubiquitous in public life, whether in the form of public monuments, street names, or national holidays. Yet such honors have received scant attention from normative political theorists. Tackling this gap, I begin by criticizing a desert-based approach to political honors. I then argue that morally appropriate honors are best understood as marking and reinforcing the moral commitments of the collective in whose name they are being awarded. I show how this thesis clarifies and organizes core intuitions regarding a variety of honors, from those commemorating slave-owning founders of the United States to the Nobel Peace Prize."
From Charlottesville to the Nobel: Political Leaders and the Morality of Political Honors,"Democratic theorists often frame humiliation as psychologically and politically corrosive, casting significant doubt on its place in a decent liberal society. Yet humiliation can engender rather than eliminate respect when it is non-coercive and revelatory of equal moral capacity—what I call “reflective humiliation.” I argue here that Kant, a paradigmatic liberal, suggests humiliation can force us to confront the inconsistency between our self-conceit and the supremacy of the moral law, inspiring critical reverence for duty or “respect for the moral law.” For Kant, reflective humiliation is thus a spiritual precondition for the recognition and exercise of political right in liberal societies."
"Kant on Humiliation, Respect, and the Moral Preconditions for Political Right","Women living in markedly different kinds of political systems—including those at the pinnacle of public life—face physical, psychological, and sexual violence; social and familial censure; marginalization; and ostracism as well as various forms of economic deprivation, physical restriction, and political exclusion. Situating such inequities in relation to modernity’s constitutive exclusion of women, this essay considers how feminist analysis makes visible and actionable raced and gendered power dynamics in contemporary states. Drawing insights from recent theorizations of feminicidal states, homosocial relations, and the managerialization of law, I explore state complicity in the perpetration of violence through discriminatory practices; harassment in halls of government; abuses by police, military, and security services; refusal to investigate and prosecute violent assaults; and court rulings that infer nondiscrimination from the mere existence of antidiscrimination policies."
"Visibility Politics: Theorizing Racialized Gendering, Homosociality, and the Feminicidal State",To what extent do consumers’ preferences change when they learn about firms’ partisan allegiances? We address this question by conducting a series of experiments in which Democrats and Republicans were presented with factual information about corporate political donations. Outcomes were measured through expressed shopping intentions as well as a revealed consumer preference. Respondents became significantly more (less) likely to patronize chains that support (oppose) their party. The effects are found for both convenience samples and representative national samples and when information is conveyed in the context of a survey or unobtrusively via direct mail. Effects are especially large among those with strong partisan attachments. We conclude by arguing that the potential for partisan consumerism has risen with the advent of social media but may be undermined by a campaign finance system that increasingly allows for undisclosed corporate donations.
Partisan Consumerism: Experimental Tests of Consumer Reactions to Corporate Political Activity,"Nearly all US residents live in metropolitan areas of various sizes and densities. Even most of “rural America” lives within “metropolitan America,” in close relationships of daily social and economic interchange with adjacent urban areas. The spatial distribution of these metropolitan nodes of settlement and activity does not correspond to the territorial boundaries that organize the US system of political representation. I argue that this mismatch poses two problems for the legitimacy of related US institutions: a form of malapportionment in which residents of different metropolitan areas arbitrarily receive different kinds of representation and a form of political fragmentation that frustrates local self-government and perpetuates distributive injustice on a national scale. I contend that these problems justify consideration of constitutional reform that would establish metropolitan regions as a principal unit of territorial constituency formation for purposes of political representation and democratic self-rule."
An Ill-Fitting Coat: Reforming US Political Boundaries for a Metropolitan Age,"While praising Deborah Puccio-Den’s proposal for its invitation to a more reflexive kind of mafia studies, capable of addressing epistemological and even ontological issues typically assumed but rarely dealt with in the literature, I suggest developing her “mafiacraft” framework along two research lines: (1) a focus on the “craft” dimension of the “mafia” and of mafiosi as engaged in work activities and embedded in (even) a (moral) division of labor; (2) adding “statecraft” to the pair mafiacraft/witchcraft in order to bring to light the political roots of the “mafia” as both a “state effect” and an instance of elementary forms of political organization paradoxically flowering inside the formal apparatus of the (Western and “modern”) state. Finally, I make a plea for a definitive recognition of the cognitive difficulties in making sense of the “mafia” as an integral part of the same phenomenon, of its semantic field, not dissimilar from other “native” terms that have entered the Western lexicon, such as “mana” and “potlatch.”"
"Mafiacraft, witchcraft, statecraft, or the politics of mafia knowledge and the knowledge of mafia politics","The QAnon conspiracy theory has garnered increasing attention as more than 80 pro-QAnon congressional candidates vied for nominations in 2020 primary races. The QAnon movement is widely characterized as “far right” and “growing,” but such claims rest on flimsy evidence. Using six public opinion polls from 2018 to 2020, we find that support for QAnon is both meager and stable across time. QAnon also appears to find support among both the political right and left; rather than partisan valence, it is the extremity of political orientations that relates to QAnon support. Finally, we demonstrate that while QAnon supporters are “extreme,” they are not so in the ideological sense. Rather, QAnon support is best explained by conspiratorial worldviews, dark triad personality traits, and a predisposition toward other nonnormative behavior. These findings have implications for the study of conspiracy theories and the spread of misinformation and suggest new directions for research on political extremism."
Who Supports QAnon? A Case Study in Political Extremism,"This article examines the process of electoral mobilization that follows the extension of voting rights to low-income citizens. We take advantage of a historically unique panel data set of official registers that includes individual voting roll calls as well as individual demographics of almost 25,000 electors in Barcelona in the 1930s, matched with relevant precinct-level socioeconomic, political, and geographical data. We show that voting was driven by the direct mobilization strategies developed by political parties and by those social organizations, such as trade unions, that encompassed an important part of society. This was the case especially among unskilled workers and in areas with a high density of working-class voters. We also show that turnout was shaped by indirect channels, such as the social networks in which partisan ideas and organizations were embedded. To identify the mobilizing effects of organizations, we rely on a variety of strategies, including a sharp, short-term change in an anarchist trade union’s electoral strategies."
From Political Mobilization to Electoral Participation: Turnout in Barcelona in the 1930s,"This paper considers the role imagination plays in radical politics, resistance, and political expression. Contemporary political theory shows that political imagination is an important resource for dominated groups because it holds possibilities for radical transformation. This paper goes beyond the existing literature’s focus on public, visible, and emancipatory instantiations of political imagination. It shows that political imagination has forms that are nonpublic and quotidian and that these must be attended to alongside public instantiations of imagination. Political imagination often moves iteratively between categories of public, private, intersubjective, and personal, and it is frequently invited by shared objects. My account of political imagination also attends equally to the ways that political imagination can foster relations of domination and to how it can be mobilized by marginalized groups for radically transformative purposes. I offer a concept of “counterimagination” to illuminate the multiplicity of ways that imagination can be transformative for political life. Counterimagination is a nonpublic form of political imagination levied by marginalized groups that holds possibilities for transformation both for the subject and for the wider political order."
Counterimagination and the Plurality of Radical Politics,"Concerns about young people’s disengagement from civic and political life, particularly disengagement of those from marginalized backgrounds, are prominent in contemporary discourse and increasingly serve as an impetus driving youth policy. Effectively engaging disadvantaged youth, however, can be difficult, and the factors that contribute to these challenges are complex. This is particularly true with regard to the engagement of young people as citizens—civic and political actors with autonomy and responsibility for contributing to the common good. This article focuses on the perspectives of disadvantaged urban youths in London, Belfast, and Dublin regarding their orientations toward civic and political life, the opportunities available to them to participate civically and politically, and the barriers they face to engagement. Based on this analysis, we outline some of the implications that young people’s perspectives and experiences provide for informing policy and practice to promote meaningful youth civic and political engagement."
Liminal Citizenship: Young People’s Perspectives on Civic and Political Engagement in Three European Cities,"In 1898, the Chinese reformer, journalist, and political thinker Liang Qichao 梁啓超 (1873–1929) made Aristotle’s political thought available to his countrymen for the first time in China’s long history. Liang’s essay “The Political Theory of Aristotle” has never been available in English, leaving most scholars who are interested in the history of Chinese political thought unable to access what one of the earliest Chinese political reformers chose to say about a philosopher he believed to be the source of Western politics. This contribution includes “The Political Theory of Aristotle,” Liang’s explication and commentary on Aristotle’s Politics, translated by Henry Zhao."
"“The Political Theory of Aristotle,” by Liang Qichao","Countries with high inflation and stringent currency regulations frequently have thriving black markets for dollars. We argue that the black market for dollars has important political consequences: it hurts the pocketbooks of many citizens and, therefore, reduces support for the government. Evidence from Argentina supports this argument. Using aggregate time series data, we estimate that a 10% increase in the black market price of the dollar relative to the official price reduces presidential approval by 2–5 percentage points in the long run. To test the pocketbook mechanism more directly, we use individual-level data from a list experiment. We find that people who bought dollars on the black market were 10 percentage points less likely to vote for the incumbent party in the 2015 presidential election. These findings suggest that the black market for dollars can have important political consequences."
The Black Market Blues: The Political Costs of Illicit Currency Markets,"Recent political events have galvanized interest in the promulgation of misinformation—particularly false rumors about political opponents. An array of studies provide reasons to think that harboring false political beliefs is a disproportionately conservative phenomenon, since citizens with affinity for the political right endorse more false information than people with affinity for the left. However, as we discuss below, past research is limited in its ability to distinguish supply-side explanations for this result (false information is spread more effectively by elites on the right) from demand-side explanations (citizens who sympathize with the right are more likely to believe false information upon receipt). We conduct an experiment on a representative sample of Americans designed specifically to reveal asymmetries in citizens’ proclivity to endorse false damaging information about political opponents. In a contrast with previous results, we find no evidence that citizens on the political right are especially likely to endorse false political information."
Ask a Political Scientist: A Conversation with Kathi Weeks about the Politics of Work and the Work of Political Theory,"We develop a model of political cycles driven by time-varying risk aversion. Agents choose to work in the public or private sector and to vote Democratic or Republican. In equilibrium, when risk aversion is high, agents elect Democrats—the party promising more redistribution. The model predicts higher average stock market returns under Democratic presidencies, explaining the well-known “presidential puzzle.” The model can also explain why economic growth has been faster under Democratic presidencies. In the data, Democratic voters are more risk averse, and risk aversion declines during Democratic presidencies. Public workers vote Democratic, while entrepreneurs vote Republican, as the model predicts."
Is the Political Right More Credulous? Experimental Evidence against Asymmetric Motivations to Believe False Political Information,"In response to the advance of right-wing populism in many Western democracies, political economists have sought explanations for political disaffection in the socioeconomic dislocations wrought by globalization, deindustrialization, and automation. Distrust of institutions and elites has been identified as a consequence of open markets and neoliberal governance. While affirming the public trust as a cornerstone of liberal democracy, this article directs analysis of the contemporary condition to a broader set of uniquely psychosocial and cultural dynamics. We identify sentiments ranging from disillusion to defiance that are now fueling a runaway politics narrowly defined around race, ethnicity, and national identity. We examine the stakes of eroding public trust in historical and theoretical perspective through an analysis of key works of Karl Polanyi, John Maynard Keynes, and E. H. Carr. Drawing parallels to their assessments of the interwar period, we argue that today’s resentment politics is not singularly the product of economic hardship or even institutional failure, but emerges also from a breakdown of the social and cultural ties that underpin liberalism—a “delicate order” built in part on sublimated psychosocial understandings of agency and community. Democracy again hangs in the balance."
Political Cycles and Stock Returns,"Why do politicians who have short tenure expectations have incentives to invest in long-term infrastructure projects? This mismatch between politicians’ short tenures and the long-term needed for infrastructure projects to come to fruition is generally expected to result in underinvestment in critical infrastructure. However, recent data show that China makes massive investments in large-scale, long-term transportation projects. By proposing a political exchange model, we demonstrate a fundamental synergy between the incentives of short-term mayors and of provincial leaders that is realized as a result of subway projects. With both a difference-in-differences design and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we show that subway projects significantly increase the promotion chances of city mayors. Additional tests also confirm the mechanism of our theory. Mayors who obtain subway projects deliver economic benefits to provincial leaders. The provincial politicians’ prospects of promotion are significantly improved thanks to these economic returns."
The Delicate Order of Liberalism: Resentment Politics and the Public Trust,"Where it concerns traditional political knowledge, on average, men have outscored women. Research indicates that part of the knowledge gap originates before adulthood, and convincing work indicates it is likely the result of unequal returns to education. Yet, no research that we know has examined the role of educators. Given research about representative bureaucracy and how a gender match between student and teacher improves girls’ performance in fields that they may otherwise perceive as dominated by men, we examine the theory’s application to political knowledge. Using administrative data from five cohorts of public school students in North Carolina, we test the hypothesis that female students will do better on a state exam in civics and economics when their teacher is a woman. Results of our analyses support the hypothesis by revealing a small but significant narrowing of the gap in test scores when students have a female teacher."
Private Returns to Public Investment: Political Career Incentives and Infrastructure Investment in China,"Studies regularly conclude that ordinary Americans lack the knowledge they need to form meaningful political preferences, leading to inefficient or counterproductive policy making. Our study of conversations about policing among black residents of highly policed neighborhoods challenges this prevailing account. We find that people possess dual, contradictory knowledge about how the state should operate based on written law and how it actually operates as a lived experience; that their knowledge is attained through involuntary encounters with the state rather than through civics education; and that this knowledge, rather than functioning to improve preferences to be communicated to an elected official, serves to help individuals distance themselves from the antidemocratic face of the state. Our findings point to a rethinking of political knowledge and its role in contemporary American democracy."
Unequal Returns to Education: How Female Teachers Narrow the Gender Gap in Political Knowledge,"Minority groups have long been underrepresented in politics. Support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights and the incidence of LGBT candidates have dramatically increased in recent years. But do voters (still) penalize LGT candidates? We conducted original survey experiments with nationally representative samples in the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. To varying degrees voters penalize LGT candidates in all countries, with penalties strongest in the United States. Yet, progressives, people with LGBT friends, and nonreligious individuals do not discriminate against gays and lesbians, while transgender candidates face stronger bias. Electability concerns, outright prejudice, and identity cueing (i.e., LGT candidates seen as more liberal) explain voter bias. This study contributes to the literature on minority candidates and disentangles correlated candidate attributes, exploring the intersectionality of bias. Understanding the barriers to the election of LGT people is crucial to improve the representation of marginalized communities."
"Too Much Knowledge, Too Little Power: An Assessment of Political Knowledge in Highly Policed Communities","This article maps out the relationship between the academic/intellectual work and political positioning of a Muslim researcher in contemporary India. It is divided into three parts. In the first part, I raise conceptual and methodological questions, especially in relation to my ongoing research on the politics of Muslim political representation. Through these questions I make an attempt to share my own anxieties and the problems that I encounter while engaging with the issues of Muslim identity. In the second part of the article, I discuss the methodological moves which I make or intend to make to deal with these questions. These moves are primarily organized as self-clarifications. In the final section, I make a broad argument for what I call intellectual politics."
"Voter Preferences and the Political Underrepresentation of Minority Groups: Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Candidates in Advanced Democracies","The leader of Mozambique’s Renamo party, Afonso Dhlakama, died on May 3, 2018. His death both necessitates an ethnographic, regionally comparative rethinking of the analytical approach to the dominant Mozambican political parties (Frelimo and Renamo) as diametrically opposed formations from independence onward and invites a more general reconsideration of anthropological approaches to politics and the trajectory of African postcolonial states. Based on long-term fieldwork in Chimoio, Maputo, and Nampula, we analyze and compare articulations of political subjectivity and launch a novel reading of Mozambique’s political dynamics, arguing how the erstwhile bifurcated political order is structured by a singular, imminent political ontology. Rather than analyzing politics by privileging institutions, identities, or movements, we contribute to an anthropology that underlines politics as fundamentally shaped by the formation and manipulation of broader systems of meaning, registers, and their spatiotemporal context—aspects that elude analyses on the basis of political discourse or voting patterns. Highlighting the genealogy of this political ontology and emphasizing its generative and imminent nature in terms of forging subjectivity, we explore its enduring yet brittle nature, which includes hegemonic stasis, contestation, and the potential for openings and breakdowns."
"Dependency in the Twenty-First Century? The Political Economy of China–Latin America Relations, by Barbara Stallings","Political systems enable many goals that consumers can aspire toward and achieve. When consumers believe the system they are embedded in is irresponsible, political cues—that is, reminders of the political system—heighten their desire for responsible governance. This desire, in turn, evokes consumers’ own goals to be responsible, increasing utilitarian (vs. hedonic) preferences. Employing quasi-experimental methods, we first show that salience of political cues accompanying Election (vs. non-Election) Day increases utilitarian preference (study 1). Employing experiments, we then show that situational political (vs. nonpolitical) cues also increase utilitarian preference, among consumers desiring responsible governance (study 2), by heightening consumers’ own goals to be responsible (studies 3A–3B). We also find marketers employ goal-consistent advertising: political (vs. nonpolitical) podcasts include more utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product advertisements (study 4). The effects are independent of consumers’ ideology or mood. This research thus introduces novel theory incorporating the macroinstitutional influence of political cues on consumer goals and choice."
"Researching India’s Muslims: Identities, methods, politics","While recent research finds strong evidence that birth order affects outcomes such as education, IQ scores, earnings, and health, the evidence for effects on political outcomes is more limited. Using population-wide data from Sweden, our within-family estimates show that firstborns are significantly more likely to run for and be elected to political office. In addition, for the males in our sample we test whether a number of potential mechanisms account for the relationship between birth order and political participation. Disconfirming our expectations, the birth order effects are only marginally smaller when controlling for occupational economic status, cognitive ability, and leadership skills. Our results suggest that big brother, or for that matter big sister, not only sees us; to a certain extent he or she also rules us."
"Just out of Reach: Imminence, Meaning, and Political Ontology in Mozambique","The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) protests have witnessed unprecedented levels, both in terms of size and violence expressed by the young protesters of Hong Kong. The outbreak of the revolt against Beijing has surprised many because it was widely believed that Hong Kongers had lost the heart to fight for freedom and democracy after the failure of the Umbrella Movement in 2014. The Anti-ELAB protests constitute a paradoxical phenomenon that leads one to question what has caused disillusionment and low political engagement of young people since 2014, and their violent comeback in 2019. This essay endeavors to unravel possible sources of anger, fear, and despair that have prompted so many young people to act collectively and violently in the current antiauthoritarian protests."
Evoking Goals to Be Responsible: When Political Cues Increase Utilitarian Choice,"Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political views of the two biggest US multiracial groups—White-Asians and White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes. Leveraging the largest national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely to benefit the Democratic Party."
"Big Brother Sees You, but Does He Rule You? The Relationship between Birth Order and Political Candidacy","This essay argues for the primacy of aesthetic resources, which use appeals to the senses and emotions more than interpersonal negotiation or empirical reasoning, in contemporary Chinese political communication. Chinese officials and citizens create politically acceptable utterances by assembling existing aesthetic resources in particular orders. This strategy has partly been forced on the party state by its internally contradictory history and has partly resulted from the use of advertising and marketing techniques. Excessive reliance on aesthetic resources, and the miscellaneous and inconsistent nature of the resources chosen, may prove to be a political weakness for the party state."
The Radical Right and Anti-Immigrant Politics in Liberal Democracies since World War II: Evolution of a Political and Research Field,"Polarization is both a description of the current state of politics and a dynamic path that has rippled across the political domain over decades. We provide a simple model that explains why polarization appears incrementally and why it was elites who polarized first and more dramatically, whereas mass polarization came later and has been less pronounced. We incorporate an ostensibly unrelated finding about how voters form preferences into a dynamic model of elections. This change, when combined with the response of strategic candidates, creates a feedback loop that can replicate many features of the data. We explore the model’s implications for other aspects of politics and trace what it predicts for the future of polarization."
Vulnerability Politics: The Uses and Abuses of Precarity in Political Debate by Katie Oliviero,"How does electoral manipulation affect elected officials’ willingness to satisfy their constituents? Although the literature has highlighted the role of elections as mechanisms of accountability, we do not know how elections whose integrity is compromised influence elected officials’ actions in office. We present a model of accountability that allows for electoral manipulation and derive three results: (i) rent extraction increases with the level of electoral manipulation, (ii) the value of holding office is positively related to rent extraction for high values of office, and (iii) electoral manipulation increases with the value of office. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that exploits rules determining the sizes of polling stations in Colombia, we estimate a positive causal effect of vote buying on the likelihood of the election winner being sanctioned for violating the disciplinary code of public officials. Consistent with the theory, we find that higher values of office are not linked to fewer sanctions but are associated with more vote buying."
Youth political agency in Hong Kong’s 2019 antiauthoritarian protests,"Reversing course from a long tradition of studying racial antipathy, I argue that racial sympathy, defined as white distress over black misfortune, shapes public opinion among a nontrivial subset of white Americans. Using an original measure—the racial sympathy index—I find that sympathy motivates support for policies perceived to benefit, as well as opposition to policies perceived to harm, African Americans. Racial sympathy is distinct from a more general sympathy, as it does not shape opinion related to other groups. The concept is foremost a racial attitude; as evidence of this, I find that sympathy is activated when a policy draws attention to its black beneficiaries. In probing this effect, I find that even exposure to negative stereotypes of blacks does not extinguish the influence of sympathy. The consistent results across multiple national studies suggest that racial sympathy represents a distinct dimension of American racial attitudes."
Multiracial Identity and Political Preferences,"This article asks why property claimants bring their cases to court in authoritarian regimes when many perceive the system to be corrupt and coopted by more powerful political players. An in-depth case study in Kyrgyzstan shows how an elite property claimant (Azim) sought to build authority for his property claims and to facilitate their continued salience in fluid political contexts by taking cases to court. Although Azim filed and won cases, the rulings were not enforced; yet he still continued to make claims, hoping that changing political environments would at some future time lead to the creation of authoritative bureaucratic and enforcement mechanisms that would render those claims valid. My broader finding is that in weak rule-of-law societies, it is important to take seriously the interplay between aspirational motivations and political contexts in order to understand the pursuit of legal strategies that would otherwise seem puzzling."
Aesthetic Resources in Contemporary Chinese Politics,"There is substantial evidence indicating that the NRA’s (National Rifle Association) political influence is closely tied to the deep political engagement of the minority of Americans who oppose strict gun control laws. This explanation of the NRA’s influence, however, raises its own questions; namely, why are gun owners so devoted to their cause, and why is the NRA so effective at mobilizing them? I marshal a wide range of evidence covering nearly nine decades to demonstrate that an important cause of the political activity of gun owners is the NRA’s long-term cultivation and dissemination of a distinct, politicized gun owner social identity, which the NRA uses to mobilize mass political action on its behalf. My findings shed new light on the ability of interest groups to develop and use resources that help them influence policy by altering the political behavior of members of the mass public."
Cause and Effect in Political Polarization: A Dynamic Analysis,"Between 2014 and 2020, China brought back from South Korea 716 sets of remains of Chinese soldiers who had died in the Korean War (1950–53). Why did the Chinese government decide to repatriate the remains of fallen soldiers only after so many years had passed? What are Beijing’s political motivations? We argue that the Chinese Communist Party utilizes the repatriation of war remains as a propaganda opportunity to appeal to veterans and to boost military morale and nationalistic support of the Party. Our study investigates the first cases of repatriating war dead from Myanmar in 2011 and traces policy developments since the establishment of the Ministry of Veterans Affairs in 2018. Our findings enhance understanding of the changing relationship between the Communist Party and vital constituencies in China."
"Political Agency, Election Quality, and Corruption","Deaf artist Frank Beard, a leading political cartoonist of the Gilded Age, developed a visual idiom that combined partisanship and provocation with new print technologies to extend viewer engagement. As he repudiated partisan politics and embraced religion, he developed new sticky forms of media—chalk talks, fundamentalist cartoons, and hieroglyphic Bibles—meant to “catch the eye, fasten the attention, quicken the imagination and enthrall the soul.” His visual logic not only embodies the complexities and contradictions of Progressive Era politics, it also allows for a reexamination of the relationship between religion, nationalism, and political cartooning."
Racial Sympathy and Its Political Consequences,"This article uses the reading patterns of New York’s earliest elites—including a significant number of the founding fathers—who checked out books from the New York Society Library (NYSL), to evaluate the shifting meaning of political affiliation in the years between the ratification of the Constitution and the War of 1812. The reading data come from two charging ledgers spanning two periods (1789–92 and 1799–1806) during which a new country was built, relations with foreign nations were defined, and contestation over the character of a new democracy was intense. Using novel combinations of text and network analysis, I explore the political nature of reading and the extent to which social, economic, and political positions overlapped with what people read. In the process, I identify the key social and cultural dimensions on which New York and, by extension, American elite society was politically stratified in its early years."
"Property, Lawfare, and the Politics of Hope in Weak States","Purpose: Drawing upon research into standards reform, and theorizing of professional and political capital, this article seeks to understand the development of and advocacy for the Next Generation Science Standards in the United States. As well as revealing how professional capital exists in three dimensions—human, social, and decisional—the research argues professional capital also needs to be understood as inherently political. Research Methods/Approach: The research draws upon interviews and discussions with key educators who developed and supported the Next Generation Science Standards at state and national levels. Findings: The article reveals political capital as vital for promoting educational standards reform, managing perceptions of reform, and making pragmatic decisions to ground reform in context. Political capital is a complex, contingent capacity vital to the development and acceptance of science education reform. Implications: Findings have implications for understanding power dynamics that characterize reform in schooling systems and professional contexts more broadly."
"The Political Weaponization of Gun Owners: The National Rifle Association’s Cultivation, Dissemination, and Use of a Group Social Identity","Political liberals believe that compliance with a norm of public reason facilitates the realization of cooperation and civic friendship among cocitizens. However, a developing literature in political psychology provides strong reasons for skepticism that public reason will equally ensure that women and men realize these values. Instead, the norm of public reason—at least in common specifications—favors characteristically male forms of deliberation. We propose supplementing public reason with a norm of rapport, which conceives of deliberation as an interactive engagement requiring proattitudes and actions from speaker and listener alike."
The Politics of Bones: The Political Motives behind the Repatriation of Remains of Chinese Soldiers Killed in the Korean War,"In recent decades, democratic countries have negotiated hundreds of international treaties and agreements. This paper analyzes the equilibrium design of treaties negotiated by political incumbents seeking reelection. We show that incumbents are prone to negotiate treaties that are “weak,” in that they may or may not be complied with: this makes it possible to differentiate the alternative candidates in a way that favors the incumbent. We also show that political economy considerations lead to overambitious treaties that rely too much on technology instead of sanctions to motivate compliance. Our theory can rationalize several puzzles associated with treaties."
"Slow Time and Sticky Media: Frank Beard’s Political Cartoons, Chalk Talks, and Hieroglyphic Bibles, 1860–1905","Formed in Chicago in 1968, AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) dedicated itself to producing art for Black people independent of white-controlled museums and markets. Examining business records from the Archives of American Art’s Jeff Donaldson Papers, this essay contributes to recent conversations about Black collectivity by exploring how AfriCOBRA navigated capitalism to sustain its revolutionary art practice. In doing so, I argue for the significance of AfriCOBRA as a political economy: a system for producing and distributing Black culture."
The Materiality of Ideology: Cultural Consumption and Political Thought after the American Revolution,"The special issue’s editors introduce the rationale for the following articles, all of which take up aspects of the relations among the production of artworks, the behavior of audiences, and the state’s interest in assembling, regulating, and transforming what it knows as its people through the responses to art."
Professional Capital as Political Capital: Science Standards Reform in the United States,"Decades of research have illuminated the pernicious effects of white racial prejudice on American politics. However, by focusing on prejudice, scholars have neglected other racial attitudes that might be relevant to whites’ political preferences. Our project addresses this omission by exploring how American politics is affected by white collective guilt—defined as remorse that a white person experiences due to her group’s actions toward black people. We expect collective guilt to motivate white support for both policies perceived to benefit African Americans and black politicians; we also theorize conditions under which collective guilt is uniquely activated. We examine these expectations using original data from five national surveys, including two embedded experiments. The results reveal that collective guilt has considerable explanatory power, even after taking standard measures of racial attitudes into account. We conclude that collective guilt is an independent racial attitude with significant consequences for white opinion."
Public Reasoning Together: Gender and Political Deliberation,"This article examines how expectations about the likelihood of a dictator’s death affect the strategic calculations of regime insiders and potential challengers. On the one hand, would-be reformers are better positioned to plan and execute post-death challenges as dictators age. On the other hand, regime insiders anticipate these challenges and try to proactively solve the problem of political succession. The circumstances surrounding leader death determine which of these competing effects dominates. Accordingly, leader death is more liberalizing as leaders age in personalist regimes compared to nonpersonalist regimes, and in countries with high levels of economic development compared to those with low levels of development. Furthermore, preemptive actions in personalist dictatorships, such as coup attempts and irregular removals, are more likely as leaders age and their death becomes imminent."
The Political Economy of Weak Treaties,"Rarely considered as a significant political thinker, Kurt Vonnegut is a neglected source of political criticism, theory, and practice. This article explores Vonnegut’s perspectives on war, technology, and community to demonstrate that Vonnegut’s well-known criticisms of war and technology are founded on deeper concerns surrounding human nature and the need for fellowship and community. Vonnegut comes to reject individualism, which he suggests tends to breed loneliness. For Vonnegut, the solution to many modern social and political ailments is found in the “folk society,” an intentional, small group of like-minded individuals pursuing similar goals. Vonnegut’s community and family-centered politics can ultimately only be located outside of contemporary political dichotomies and provide a significant contribution to an ongoing conversation about the potential failings of liberalism and practical remedies to them."
The Political Economy of AfriCOBRA,"Activists have sought to make American government more democratic or more effective by reducing the role of political parties. In opposition to such hostility to parties, a group of scholars and intellectuals has emerged to defend parties’ mediating role and make a case that they should be strengthened. However, the philosophical premises of the pro-party perspective often remain unarticulated. To animate a debate over the foundations of party reform, this article examines Edward C. Banfield’s political thought and how it informs his support of strong parties. Banfield is an important forerunner of the strong-parties position, and he offers a broad philosophical perspective that could underpin it. Based on an examination of Banfield’s political thought and his defense of the American party system, the article concludes that Banfield presents a challenge to contemporary scholars who reject his conclusions about the prospects for rational reform of the party system."
Political Enchantments: Aesthetic Practices and the Chinese State,"For many commentators, the present age reminds them of Richard Hofstadter’s writings on the paranoid style. Proliferation of references, however, does not mean consistency of terminology. How did Hofstadter conceive of Far Right rhetoric? This article is an interpretive analysis, focusing first on his account of how pseudoconservatives effectively utilized paranoid rhetoric. Next, I explore Hofstadter’s view of mass politics, showing a connection between promoters of political paranoia and consumers of paranoid ideas: crucially, he saw the paranoid style as requiring resentful masses to be effective. Finally, I point out some differences between Hofstadter’s time and today through an interpretation of a May 2017 White House document, “POTUS & Political Warfare.” I conclude that even though many of Hofstadter’s terms are applicable for the twenty-first century, some of the conditions for mass social resentment have shifted."
Guilt by Association: White Collective Guilt in American Politics,"Research shows that the presence of more female politicians can reduce gender gaps in political knowledge. Despite these findings, no study examines whether the role model effect applies to autocracies. This is an important oversight given the role political knowledge plays in increasing the use of nonelectoral forms of accountability. To test whether female political role models increase knowledge in autocracies, this study uses unique survey data from Vietnam occurring before and after a leadership change. In the transition, all the top leaders changed from male to different male leaders except for the legislative speaker, which transitioned from male to female. Results show that her selection led to a greater increase in name recognition for her position among women compared to men and that women were more likely to pay attention to legislative proceedings after her selection. These findings suggest that the role model effect travels to autocracies, although to a lesser degree."
"The World Economy, Political Control, and Presidential Success","In a recent Journal of Politics article, Daniela Campello and Cesar Zucco argue that Latin American voters credit and blame presidents for economic outcomes unambiguously exogenous to their policy choices, a claim that undermines broadly held understandings of how voters hold politicians accountable. While we concur on the importance of the global economy to politics in the region, we challenge their study on two grounds. First, we question their designation of economies as fitting a low-savings commodity-exporting profile as the key factor shaping the influence of world markets on presidential success. Second, we contend that the impact of the world economy on domestic politics depends instead on the degree of control exercised by national policy makers. In particular, the region’s unprecedented experiment with economic policy regimes informs voters’ assignment of responsibility to policy makers. A series of analyses provides support for our argument."
Debates: Voting and Expenditure Responses to Political Communication,"Candidate debates have a rich history and remain integral to contemporary campaign strategy. There is, however, little evidence that they affect the behavior of voters or politicians. The scarcity of political information in the developing world offers an attractive testing ground. Using experimental variation in Sierra Leone, we find that public debate screenings build political knowledge that changes the way people vote, which induces a campaign expenditure response by candidates and fosters accountability pressure over the spending of elected officials. Results show how political communication can trigger a chain of events that begins with voters and ultimately influences policy."
What’s Missing? A Typology of Political Absence,"Most political scientists studying representation adopt some version of Hanna Pitkin’s definition of representation as “making present what is absent.” Their emphasis is on the “making present”—that is, on how representatives gain access, voice, and decision-making authority. Although presence is an essential component of representation, understanding and properly evaluating representation requires attending not only to how representation makes groups present but also to how it makes groups absent. In particular, it is important to differentiate the various kinds of absences that constitute representation. To that end, this paper offers a typology of political absence. It identifies three relevant divisions within absence (and presence) and distinguishes strategic absences from involuntary ones. Such theoretical distinctions are central to any general theory of representation that can adequately account for how representatives make and further claims by choosing to be absent from representative processes, and explicate the democratic costs and benefits of such absences."
Licentia: Cicero on the Suicide of Political Communities,"This paper studies the term and concept of licentia in the Latin Republican corpus, focusing on Cicero’s political theory. Its first part is a philological analysis of the term. It concludes that in the first century BCE licentia had three core meanings: permission, permission to do wrong, and permissiveness. The second part is a study of the concept licentia in Cicero’s rhetoric and political theory. It shows Cicero’s awareness of the effect of permissions unduly given and permissiveness on the force of social standards at Rome."
Empowering Women? Gender Quotas and Women’s Political Careers,"Women’s representation in executive office continues to lag behind that of their female peers in legislatures, and several studies find women face an executive glass ceiling. One way to shatter this executive glass ceiling is through the adoption of legislative gender quotas. However, scholars know little about how legislative quotas affect women’s access to executive office. Previous research has been unable to determine whether once elected through quotas, women advance to executive office at similar rates to men. Using data on the future career paths of nearly 2,000 Mexican legislators, I find women face a glass ceiling in winning nomination to executive office. Using career data before and after quota implementation, and exploiting lax enforcement in the district component of the mixed electoral system, I find quotas have done little to increase the advancement of women into executive office, although they have increased opportunities for women in other legislative positions."
Invisible to Political Science: Indigenous Politics in a World in Flux,"This paper examines the content of the ÇİNEKÖY and KARATEPE Inscriptions, the selection of scripts on the monuments, and the choices of iconography on the two statues of the Storm God. These monuments represent a regionally and temporally specific practice of representation that ambiguously blends elements of divine and royal imagery into a new form, while taking a similar approach to the semiotics of rulership as the Neo-Assyrian kings. The combined elements of the monuments suggest a unique cultural strategy in which the agency of the ruler is blended with that of the Storm God, exemplifying the specific worldview of Iron Age Cilicia that informed their composition. The rulers who created these monuments sought to assert their political identity through the combination of the figural representations, the visuality of the scripts, and the content of the inscriptions; the two monuments illustrate a drastic change in the political agenda of the kingdom of Hiyawa, reflecting a shift in power among opposing political factions. These identities also contain a sense of intentional ambiguity, as the various elements do not immediately support the same message, but rather work together to propagate a multifaceted message of military prowess, commercial interconnectedness, and royal legitimacy and kingship."
Ambiguity of Divine and Royal Portraiture and the Hiyawan Image of Kingship: Political Identity through the Monuments of ÇİNEKÖY and KARATEPE,"The article investigates the impact of political competition on the level of accuracy in law enforcement. The model looks at the potential distortions implied by political competition relative to the Beckerian benchmark, where a benevolent social planner decides on the resources allocated to accuracy. I show that an elected law enforcer may promote a lower level of accuracy (for crimes inducing moderate harm) or a higher level of accuracy (for crimes inducing extensive harm) than the socially optimal level. Potential extensions are discussed in the last section."
A Conversation with Efrén Pérez about Political Psychology and the Study of Race and Ethnic Politics,"What influences gender representation in assigned readings during graduate training? Whereas recent studies have identified gender gaps in citations and publications, less is known about the readings used to train future political scientists. Introducing a unique data set of 88,673 citations from 905 PhD syllabi and reading lists, we find that only 19% of assigned readings have female first authors. Scholarship by female scholars is underrepresented in all subfields, relative to several benchmarks. Both supply- and demand-side factors affect gender representation. First, representation of female-authored readings varies by the size of the pool of female scholars, over time and across subfields. Second, instructor gender and department composition affect demand for female-authored scholarship. As departments hire more female faculty, instructors of both genders become more likely to assign female-authored work. This article contributes an original data set to the study of graduate training and advances understanding of gender diversity in political science."
Accuracy in Public Law Enforcement under Political Competition,"In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch called for the reversal of Employment Division v. Smith (1990), the Supreme Court’s leading Free Exercise Clause precedent. For years, Smith has been targeted by originalists who contend that, among other things, Smith is incompatible with a Madisonian understanding of religious freedom. This article challenges that conclusion. It attempts to do so not by employing the typical tools of originalist legal scholarship, but rather by setting forth Madison’s political science of religious liberty. The article argues the logic of Federalist 10 is incompatible with exemptions from generally applicable laws and, therefore, that a Madisonian construction of the Free Exercise Clause would not support a constitutional right to religious exemptions. Insofar as Federalist 10 articulates the Constitution’s underlying structural design, Free Exercise Clause exemptions undermine one of the principal mechanisms that Madison believed would protect liberty, including religious liberty."
The Gender Readings Gap in Political Science Graduate Training,"The revival of scholarly interest in political rhetoric is salutary, but has unnecessarily focused on defending only the kind of rhetoric whose end is to persuade listeners to change their judgments. In this article, I explore an additional style of rhetoric that has another aim: that of motivating or inspiriting listeners to support with vigorous action a judgment already made. Such rhetoric is not simply a species of persuasive rhetoric, and therefore must be justified on its own terms. I argue that motivational rhetoric is fundamentally linked to a particular psychological phenomenon: akrasia, or weakness of will. Through an examination of classical theorists of rhetoric, as well as contemporary debates and empirical research, I attempt to distinguish motivational rhetoric from its persuasive counterpart and make a preliminary defense for it as a legitimate mode of political speech."
James Madison’s Political Science of Religious Liberty,"This paper offers a reading of C. Memmius’ characterization in Catullus 10 and 28 in light of coinage, RRC 427/1, issued by his nephew and hailing him as C. MEMMIVS IMPERATOR for unknown victories in Bithynia. Catullus transforms this imperatorial acclamation in Poem 10 into an obscene pun that renders Memmius an irrumator rather than an imperator and mocks the promagistrate’s triumphal aspirations. This reading places Catullus’ poem more firmly in its political context and sheds light on both Memmius’ political career and his other famous appearance in Roman literature, as dedicatee of Lucretius’ De rerum natura."
Beyond Persuasion: Rhetoric as a Tool of Political Motivation,"Do class divisions and fear of redistribution impede political transitions? This article argues that tensions over economic redistribution in European settler colonies caused resisted enfranchisement and liberation wars in colonial Africa. It offers three main contributions. First, it identifies key scope conditions for redistributive transition models: in African settler colonies, the European elite monopolized the best agricultural land and could only secure their economic advantages by repressing majority rule—also incentivizing liberation wars. Second, it exploits a novel research design to assess redistributive theories. Statistical evidence from Africa during the decolonization era demonstrates that larger European settler population shares covary with smaller franchises and with more frequent colonial liberation wars. To account for the endogeneity of European settlement, the article introduces an instrument that measures climatic and other land suitability factors that affected where Europeans could settle. Third, it explains divergent decolonization paths."
Irrumator/Imperator: A Political Joke in Catullus 10?,"There are good reasons to think that fiscal austerity can have important costs, and among these is political instability. We suggest that these political costs may be harder to identify than one might assume. Using a broad sample of countries from 1870 to 2011, we ask whether expenditure cuts are associated with increased leader turnover through either regular or irregular means. Ordinary least squares estimates suggest that there is no effect, but this may be due to a bias whereby leaders adopt austerity only when they think they can survive it. As an alternative empirical strategy, we also report instrumental variables estimates in which expenditure cuts are instrumented by exogenous trade and financial shocks, and we continue to observe a null result. Finally, we consider which interpretations of voter behavior might be consistent with our results."
Redistributive Political Transitions: Minority Rule and Liberation Wars in Colonial Africa,"This essay revisits Othello’s jealousy to detail the politico-theological significance of this dramatic affect. In the Hebrew Bible, jealousy maintains a covenant between God and a holy nation. When Pauline teaching defines marriage as an index of Christ’s love, this redefinition promises to replace exclusivity with a supposedly universal truth. Yet jealousy persists to reveal a clash between individual realities and corporate truths. Jealousy performs this by underscoring the fictive nature of the identification of a husband with Christ. Before The Winter’s Tale relates the problems of jealousy to a hereditary monarchy, Othello locates them within a republic. The Venetian state sidesteps the effects of tragedy because its perpetuation exists at a remove from marriage. Yet for this reason, it cannot assist Othello in occupying the fictions of Christian marriage. Othello shows us how politico-theological meaning can be communicated artistically, and in a way that thwarts any interpretation that locates real meaning in a forward-looking trajectory of state power. This essay concludes by arguing that Othello helps us to pinpoint the deficiencies in Carl Schmitt’s reading of Hamlet—and, more generally, in the way Schmitt conscribes the power of Shakespearean tragedy for his tendentious view of political history. [E.S.]"
How Large Are the Political Costs of Fiscal Austerity?,"Local politicians can play an important role in promoting citizenship, but their helpfulness varies considerably across local councils. Do politicians discriminate against immigrants seeking to naturalize in ways that public opinion and national citizenship debates would suggest? In two correspondence studies fielded in Germany, we find no evidence that features that are salient in national debates and public opinion predict responsiveness. Specifically, signals of national identification and attachment play no role. Instead, we document a reversed national penalty: politicians are 50% more likely to assist a large low-status group (Turks) than a small high status-group (Canadians). When probing mechanisms via elite interviews, we find that the desire to promote integration and electoral participation can counteract biases that typically generate discrimination. Among politicians, factors associated with group size can therefore help reverse penalties against low-status groups. Research on citizenship and discrimination must consider these disconnects between public perceptions, national debates, and local politics."
Othello and the Political Theology of Jealousy,"Definitions of violence are contested, ranging from minimalistic conceptions privileging physical attacks to more comprehensive approaches recognizing a broad array of physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violations. Investigating the phenomenon of violence against women in politics, I theorize semiotic violence as a fifth form of violence against women, one that mobilizes sexist words and images to injure, discipline, and subjugate women. While perpetrated against individual women, these acts amplify gender inequalities by suggesting to the general public that women as a group are unworthy. Drawing on research in multiple disciplines, as well as a global database of news items collected between 2014 and 2019, I identify two modes of semiotic violence: rendering women invisible and rendering women incompetent. The first seeks to erase women as political actors and deny their right to speak and be heard in political debates. The second rejects women’s qualifications to serve in political roles based on gendered tropes related to temperament, knowledge, sexual objectification, and femininity. Semiotic violence is not only part of a broader continuum of violence, I suggest, but also the most widespread, concealed, and trivialized form of violence against women. Recognizing semiotic violence is thus important for both feminist research and activism, creating new vocabularies to speak about women’s experiences—and, in turn, challenging the structural inequalities that normalize these harms."
National Penalties Reversed: The Local Politics of Citizenship and Politician Responsiveness to Immigrants,"Understanding the drivers of party issue emphasis and the specific role of public opinion is important to shed light on the mechanisms of contemporary party competition and to assess the quality of representation in liberal democracies. Previous research has produced conflicting results between issue ownership and issue dialogue perspectives and has ignored the role of time in party communication strategy. We present a theory focused on the economy in which proximity to election day increases the incumbent’s cost of not responding to opponent attacks and subsequently decreases the incumbent’s attention to public opinion. We validate the main empirical implications of the model via content analysis of party discourse in Spanish parliamentary speeches (1996–2011) and time series analyses. Our results have pessimistic implications for an ideal conception of bottom-up representation. As electoral accountability pressures increase over the electoral cycle, endogenous party competition overshadows public opinion as a driver of representatives’ agenda."
Semiotic Violence against Women: Theorizing Harms against Female Politicians,"On 24 July 2012, the Sansha People’s Government was established on an anthropogenic island in the South China Sea, more than 350 kilometers from the southernmost point of Hainan Province. Sansha is the PRC’s smallest city, occupying roughly ten square kilometers on Woody Island and housing a population of just over a thousand; at the same time, it is also the PRC’s largest city, symbolically laying claim to thousands of kilometers of space in the South China Sea. Alongside the ambitious logistical and military projects to build Sansha into part of China, highlighting an official shift from temporal to territorial nationalism, a corresponding state aesthetic project has consolidated in citizens’ minds a distant island that most will never see. The resulting cultural products portray a new addition of territory as an eternal part of China, while a remote island is constructed as an integral yet also mystical part of the nation-state. Examining artistic portrayals of the island across mediums including film, poetry, and painting, this article critically analyzes newly emerging trends in state and popular nationalism in China today."
Economic Responsiveness and the Political Conditioning of the Electoral Cycle,"Whether in their standoff with the Bureau of Land Management or their takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Cliven, Ammon, and Ryan Bundy frequently pledge fidelity to and express reverence for the Constitution. This article examines the Bundys’ constitutional philosophy as an example of “radical constitutional libertarianism”—an ideology that simultaneously seeks the displacement of the basic procedural norms of the political order and speaks in the name of the most traditional substantive values of that order. More specifically, I attempt to excavate the Bundys’ views on each of three core ideational pillars (sovereignty, property, liberty) and to sketch how they interact to produce a composite vision in sharp contrast to established understandings of American constitutionalism. In so doing, I illustrate how the Bundys translate the Constitution for—and apply the Constitution to the daily lives of—ordinary citizens to shape the boundary conditions of contemporary American political culture."
Seeing Sansha: The Political Aesthetics of a South China Sea Settlement,"Once known for its fashion, beauty, and celebrity coverage, Teen Vogue has recently reinvented itself into an intersectional feminist digital platform advancing progressive social justice issues. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s writing on “feminist snap,” this article explores Teen Vogue as a pertinent example of public feminism that diverges from the popular, neoliberal feminisms that have been the focus of much feminist media studies research. I mobilize “radical impatience” and “refusal” as analytical concepts that distinguish Teen Vogue’s feminist politics while considering how they operate through both mediated representation and material activist culture. Ultimately, I contend that Teen Vogue’s intersectional feminist politics pose a challenge to neoliberal feminisms while reimagining youthful femininity as a subjectivity with political agency that threatens patriarchal authority in politics. In doing so, this article builds on existing scholarship on popular feminism while demonstrating the need to employ a wider analytic lens to understand the diverse constellation of public feminisms within contemporary media cultures."
Saints and Politics (Heo's The Political Lives of Saints: Christian-Muslim Mediation in Egypt),"Ralph Waldo Emerson sometimes proclaims radical individualism and a deep antagonism to associational living. Other times—especially in the context of abolitionism and reformism—he urges solidarity and membership in associations. We can understand Emerson as a consistent political theorist through his treatment of moral authority, which he suggests must be located beyond associational life. In Emerson’s writings, moral authority takes two forms: a positive embrace of a moral superstructure (variously called the “Over-Soul,” “God,” “Genius,” and more), and a negative or critical resistance against the corrupting features of associational life. This article sheds light on the extent to which these seemingly disparate features of Emerson’s political theory overlap and sometimes operate in tandem. By illuminating the external quality of moral authority, this article enables a fuller appreciation of Emerson’s democratic political theory."
Paradoxology and Politics: How Isocrates Sells His School and His Political Agenda in the Busiris,"Until recently, the study of representation at the subnational level was hobbled by the lack of high-quality information about public opinion. The advent of new data sources, however, as well as of new methods such as multilevel regression and poststratification, has greatly enhanced scholars’ capacity to describe public opinion in states, legislative districts, cities, and other subnational units. These advances in measurement have in turn revolutionized the study of subnational representation. In this article, we summarize new approaches to the measurement of subnational opinion. We then review recent developments in the study of the role of subnational public opinion in the political process and discuss potentially fruitful avenues for future research."
Political Radicalism and Pocket Constitutionalism: The Bundys and Beyond,"In Hamlet the crisis of political authority that famously rots Denmark is registered as an aesthetic crisis—a crisis of perception, feeling, and experience. This essay recovers this broken regime of feeling under the tradition of “majesty,” which in the period described the conventional set of affective and sensible experiences one was supposed to have in the presence of a sovereign prince. Whereas other contemporary plays such as Richard II often dispelled majesty as theatrical illusion, this essay argues that Hamlet takes majesty seriously but redescribes its enchantments to fit a new, post-Reformation decorum of sensibility characterized by dissensus. Here feelings of majesty most indicate sovereignty’s divine authority when, paradoxically, they fail, unable (precisely as exceptional feelings of exceptional authority) to command common agreement. This essay thus counters readings that overemphasize the epistemic nature of Hamlet’s crisis and resituates its aesthetic modernism at the intersection of phenomenology and political theology. [E.G.]"
A Politics of Snap: Teen Vogue’s Public Feminism,"Very few issues in librarianship have risen to the level of notoriety and controversy as the Beall’s List affair (as I call it). It has generated national publicity, controversy, recriminations, and a retirement. After so much has been written, it would seem little more could be said. One overlooked aspect of the affair is an examination of its political sociology: What are the groups/groupings that were prominent? What were their arguments supporting, opposing, modifying, influencing, envisioning, or deciding on the issues raised in the Beall’s List affair? And what were the relative power relationships among them? This article seeks to map those relationships and the arguments deployed to better situate library and information science within a broader environment and identify the forces at work within and on the field."
Keeping the “Perfect Sweetness … of Solitude”: Toward a Consistent Emersonian Political Theory,"Democracy is possible because of an increase in the complexity of society, but that same complexity seems to threaten democracy. There is a clear imbalance between people’s actual competence and the expectation that citizens in a democratic society will be politically competent. It is not only that society has become more complex but that democratization itself increases the degree of social complexity. This unintelligibility can be overcome through the acquisition of some political competence—such as improving individual knowledge, diverse strategies for simplification or recourse to the experts—that partially reduce this imbalance. My hypothesis is that despite the attraction of de-democratizing procedures, the best solutions are those that are most democratic: strengthening the cooperation and the institutional organization of collective intelligence. The purpose of this article is not to solve all the problems I touch on, but rather to examine how they are related and to provide a general framework for the problem of de-democratization through misunderstanding."
"Patrick Müller, ed., Shaping Enlightenment Politics: The Social and Political Impact of the First and Third Earls of Shaftesbury","Alexander Hamilton once asserted that a “systematic or able statesman” needs a “theory.” This article examines Alexander Hamilton’s use of political ideas concerning one issue: the origin of an obligation to obey a government. It begins by exploring the theoretical foundations of two revolutionary-era pamphlets, which are, contrary to a leading interpretation, classically liberal. It then turns to a series of four Federalist essays, the theoretical basis of which has not been carefully examined. There Hamilton adopts a very different account, drawing directly from Hume, the most thorough critic of social contract theory. Against the conclusions that Hamilton had either abandoned Locke entirely or selected theories to fit the circumstances, this article argues that Hamilton developed a coherent amalgamation, one appropriate for a statesman, with Locke as a source of ends and Hume as a guide to the means."
Public Opinion in Subnational Politics,"This article examines political criticism and oppositional discourses on China’s Internet from 2012, near the end of Hu Jintao’s era, up through the current Xi Jinping administration. We focus on two main types of Internet activity in which criticism and discourses emerge—online mass incidents and defiant enclaves—and compare their discursive elements. The core messages and critiques by leading activists and dissidents and their followers in the latter have become more multilayered, radical, and antiregime. Both types of political dissent are alive and persist, but the potential for them to connect various social grievances has declined in recent years, as state control over the Internet and digital spaces has significantly tightened."
The Experience of Authority: Hamlet and the Political Aesthetics of Majesty,This article shows that the emergence of new nonscholarly literature about the Jewish Brigade Group produced contrasting interpretations in Italy of the roles played by the Jews and the Arabs of Palestine during World War II. This led to a political quarrel that eventually resulted in a disconcerting split within the Italian antifascist front. The article aims to contribute to a resolution of this crisis by reaffirming the role of professional historians vis-à-vis the public and political uses of history that characterize the dispute. It does so through the primary tool of the historian: archival documents.
A Political Sociology of the Beall’s List Affair,"Scholars traditionally classify the uses of imprisonment in Athens as custodial, coercive, and punitive: detention of litigants prior to prosecution and convicts awaiting punishment, debtors interned until payment of fines, and convicts sentenced to bondage as a penalty, respectively. Ancient authors, by contrast, portray imprisonment as political, part of the agonistic dimensions of Athenian democracy. This study identifies all known inmates in the Athenian prison and argues that the historical and literary record substantiates the ancient view; in periods of heighted factional tension, the adversarial nature of democratic politics subsumed even such auxiliary administrative operations as custodial and coercive incarceration."
No Democracy Without Comprehension: Political Unintelligibility as A Democratic Problem,"While congressional committee members sometimes hold hearings to collect and transmit specialized information to the floor, they also use hearings as venues to send political messages by framing an issue or a party to the public which I refer to as “grandstanding.” However, we lack clear understanding of when they strategically engage in grandstanding. I argue that when committee members have limited legislative power they resort to making grandstanding speeches in hearings to please their target audience. Using 12,820 House committee hearing transcripts from the 105th to 114th Congresses and employing a crowd-sourced supervised learning method, I measure a “grandstanding score” for each statement that committee members make. Findings suggest that grandstanding efforts are made more commonly among minority members under a unified government, by nonchair members of powerful committees, and in committees with jurisdiction over policies where the president wields primary power, such as foreign affairs and national security."
Alexander Hamilton and the Origin of Political Obligation,"This article revisits the political thought of the Georgia Populist Thomas E. Watson (1856–1922), with a focus on themes such as Caesarism, agrarian equality, and republican decline. After a failed vice presidential run in 1896, Watson published a volley of books on topics such as Jefferson, the French Revolution, Roman history, and Napoleon. These works combined a predilection for Caesarist leaders from Bonaparte to Cromwell with an intense anti-monarchism. Although historians have focused on Watson’s journey from biracial organizer to racist firebrand, his later literary oeuvre has rarely been treated as offering a mature political theory. Through a close reading of Watson’s output after 1896, this article uncovers linkages between Watson’s agrarian republicanism and his Caesarist proclivities, embedded in a wider political landscape. This reading clarifies Populism’s republican debts and its tensions with debates on populism today, but also deepens our understanding of republican defenses of Caesarism in the nineteenth century."
From Online Mass Incidents to Defiant Enclaves: Political Dissent on China’s Internet,"Through a case study of a peace education intervention in postwar Sierra Leone, this article seeks to contribute to the ongoing critique of dominant peace education approaches that seek attitudinal and behavioral change in conflict-affected societies. Specifically, the article interrogates “Emerging Issues,” a curriculum intervention developed in 2007–8 by UNICEF for teachers in Sierra Leone. It applies the analytical framework of Cultural Political Economy, an interdisciplinary theoretical current that extends traditional concerns of political economy with power and institutions to show their interaction with cultural processes of meaning making. The insights suggest that this approach to peace education might not be as benign as projected. Instead, we assert that it promotes a form of pacification derived from a decontextualized curriculum that treats victims as guilty and in need of attitudinal and behavioral change, while avoiding engagement with the structural and geopolitical drivers that underpin many contemporary conflicts."
The Jewish Brigade Group and Italy: A Political and Historiographical Quarrel,"An introduction to an interview with Michel Foucault in 1979, which contextualizes his general stance on the Iranian uprising, as well as his conception of philosophical journalism and political spirituality, his rejection of the teleology of history, and his willingness to let historically silenced subjects speak for themselves."
"Political Prisoners in Democratic Athens, 490–318 BCE Part I: The Athenian Inmate Population","What explains racial inequalities in law enforcement and criminal justice policy? I argue that political representation plays a key role. Most explanations of representation focus on partisanship or use a left-right scale to measure the effectiveness of representation. However, liberal cities like Berkeley, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Seattle have racial disparities in policing that dwarf those found in Ferguson, the nation’s exemplar of unequal policing. Divisions by party and divisions by race interact to produce serious problems of representation on issues related to crime, policing, and violence. Black and white Democrats do not hold similar views; for both historical and electoral reasons, white Democrats have typically determined the party’s policy stances. As a result, black Americans face substantial barriers to obtaining representation on criminal justice issues (and beyond) through a partisan political system. Researchers should analyze parties as coalitions rather than homogeneous groups."
When Do Politicians Grandstand? Measuring Message Politics in Committee Hearings,"Social groups often differ in vote choice, but differences vary significantly between elections. Recent work argues that political parties shape group differences by the policies they propose. I posit that differences also depend on how parties use group-based appeals. This proposition is tested with a unique data set on group-based appeals, policy-based appeals, and voter preferences in Britain from 1964 to 2015. Focusing on social class as one prominent group membership, I show how class differences in vote choice respond to policy-based as well as group-based class appeals: the gap between voters from opposing classes widens or narrows depending on how much the Labour Party emphasizes “old” symbolic ties to workers and “new” ties to businesses. These effects are robust and compare to the policy effects highlighted in previous work. Overall, this implies a revised view on how political parties influence the social divisions of electoral politics."
Caesarism and Republicanism in the Political Thought of Thomas E. Watson,"When do quotas for women’s political representation promote economic gender equality? Legislative reforms equalizing economic rights are common globally, with mixed results. I consider the impact of quotas on women’s rights in a crucial domain: property. I leverage exogenously set electoral quotas—reservations—for women as heads of local government in India. Reservations enable clean identification of the impact of representation on enforcing gender-equalizing land inheritance reforms. I find that political representation enables women to secure property rights and ensures that they are upheld. However, backlash occurs when reservations guaranteeing female representation make enforcement of reform credible. Women can reduce this backlash by using female representation to trade traditional monetary dowry for property inheritance and familial responsibilities. This, in turn, reduces the “cost” of reform to men. These findings confirm the power of political representation to not only claim economic rights but broaden their acceptance by changing perceptions of parity."
Rethinking Peace Education: A Cultural Political Economy Approach,"In the name of cleaning up Kampala’s political institutions and public space, a new municipal body, the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), was established in 2010, replacing an elected city council with a presidentially appointed executive director. To legitimize its highly contested and explicitly antipolitical authority, the KCCA made garbage collection and beautification its top priority, promising to deliver routine urban repair and mundane maintenance work in exchange for suspending the norms of electoral democracy in Uganda’s capital city. This article argues that the exceptional space of the repair site is paradigmatic of municipal power over the city as a whole. Based on an ethnography of municipal waste management infrastructure and an analysis of the KCCA’s visual account of itself, it elaborates the concept of maintenance space to theorize how the entanglement of sovereign and governmental power produces the city as a particular kind of territory. Because the work of maintenance and repair is continuous and ongoing, maintenance space endures. Far from a short-lived inconvenience, its exception becomes the foundational norm of technocratic authority. Not limited to Kampala, the enduring exception of maintenance space, I conclude, identifies a widespread mode of urban spatial production and depoliticization."
American Imperial Development,"Although sociologists and psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that colorism shapes how Black Americans evaluate members of their racial group, the literature on colorism in electoral politics remains curiously and ironically bereft of studies of Black Americans. We fill this lacuna in our article by asking how and in what ways might the skin tone and gender of Black candidates shape Blacks’ vote intention along with perceptions of representativeness? Using an original survey experiment with 1,260 Black Americans (of which we analyze 839) that varies the gender and skin tone of political candidates, we find that darker-skinned candidates are evaluated more favorably than lighter-skinned candidates. Our results advance the research on colorism in electoral politics and have sweeping implications for the vast body of literature on descriptive representation."
The State Constitutions’ Influence on American Political Development,"Few have written so astutely about the difficulty of being both socialist and American as did Irving Howe. Seeking a “conciliation” between socialism’s solidaristic values and America’s culture of self-reliant individualism, Howe warned that the American democratic Left could not survive unless it made its peace with America’s “Emersonian” mood. Yet he found Emersonianism too “airy” and appreciated the “thicker” teachings of Hawthorne and Melville and of European writers steeped in biblical stories. Although his efforts to reach a conciliation with individualism were problematic, Howe at times suggested a better way to reconcile socialism with American political culture: a solidaristic ethic beyond liberal individualism, drawing on the marginal but persistent fraternal themes in American political culture."
Introduction to Michel Foucault’s “Political Spirituality as the Will for Alterity”,"This article reads a set of South African women’s political memoirs as both propaganda pieces and fantasy texts. Inspired by Joan W. Scott’s recent explorations of feminist fantasy, the article draws attention to a set of scenes that recur across diverse political memoirs: scenes of interracial physical and domestic intimacy and scenes of collective national voyaging. Reading these depictions as fantasies, this article argues, lets us understand these women memoirists as propagandists for a national liberation cause. In their texts, these women espouse a particular and gendered nationalism that insists on public and private intimacy as a key component of a (fantasized) free South Africa, even as they acknowledge the unease inherent in seeking out these intimacies. This reading disrupts scholarly accounts that have tended to marginalize women as contributors to nationalist discourses, and it enables a deeper analysis of the tensions of race and interracial intimacy that beset the antiapartheid movement."
"Race, Party, and Representation in Criminal Justice Politics","Contemporary political science has fetishized a product of its own invention: the elite theory of democracy. American political science’s understanding of “democratic elitism” is founded on a fundamental misreading of the Italian School of Elitism and Joseph Schumpeter’s political thought. This essay historicizes the early phases of the interpretive tradition known as democratic elitism, represented by the following authors: (1) Gaetano Mosca, Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels, (2) Joseph Schumpeter, and (3) Robert Dahl. I not only track how the Italian School’s concern over the threat of plutocracy was suppressed, and their aspirations for political transparency discounted by American political science, but also trace the shift, over time, in the literary dispositions that undergird what we now call “elite” or “minimal” theories of democracy. I argue that in contrast to the Italian theorists’ and Schumpeter’s pessimism, Dahl infused optimism into his understanding of representative government with pernicious consequences for democratic theory."
The Social Divisions of Politics: How Parties’ Group-Based Appeals Influence Social Group Differences in Vote Choice,"In the “long 1970s,” measuring well-being or quality of life was high on the agenda of international organizations, governmental agencies, and social science research centers. The article examines how their endeavors to monitor and quantify people’s quality of life spawned a new world of ideas, concepts, numbers, graphs, and facts that transformed the meaning of welfare and the postwar foundations of social and economic policy. By focusing on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s quality of life program of the 1970s, the article brings into view a variety of epistemic actors, including social scientists, governmental officials, and the bureaucrats of international organizations, and analyzes how their interactions shaped the production and circulation of new, policy-relevant knowledge in this nascent field. The article argues that the quality of life endeavors of the 1970s mark an epistemic and political shift away from the postwar concepts of material well-being and toward psychological notions of well-being; and, too, that this opened up new horizons for political intervention and paved the way to the “happiness boom” in the early twenty-first century."
"Reform, Representation, and Resistance: The Politics of Property Rights’ Enforcement","John Adams’s political thought, notably in the influential first volume to his Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States (1787), expressed what may justly be termed a Polybian political science. His Polybian political science formed the basis for a republican institutionalism, an emphasis on well-ordered constitutions to balance competing social orders in society and guard against excessive influence of the “natural aristocracy.” Adams’s contributions to the American constitutional tradition reveal that the debate over the structure of the legislature in the American state and national constitutions was a debate about the foundations of human nature and the lessons of history. Further, his republican institutionalism challenges the assertion that the American founding was essentially liberal in the Lockean sense, suggesting instead a rich synthesis of classical, medieval, and modern ideas."
"Maintenance Space: The Political Authority of Garbage in Kampala, Uganda","Most existing scholarship regards private businesspeople in China as allies of the party-state, without considering how the private sector’s policy influence is possible in an authoritarian state where the political elites dominate the policy-making process. Based on the large number of successful proposals that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) has submitted to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, this study reveals the rising policy influence of private businesspeople in the past decade. It finds that their influence on government policy is not realized simply through collusion or informal ties with local governments at the stage of policy implementation. Instead, they now can voice their interests and exert influence as a group in national policy making at the central level through formal institutional channels. In recent years the influence of business associations affiliated with the ACFIC has been increasing, mainly due to institutional changes at the national level that encompass their input. This entails political co-optation that helps empower the private sector to exert influence on policy, rendering it unnecessary for the business community to challenge the political system from the bottom up."
A Certain Type of Descriptive Representative? Understanding How the Skin Tone and Gender of Candidates Influences Black Politics,"Tobacco consumption jumped from 80 billion cigarettes in 1949 to 1.7 trillion in the mid-1990s as the Chinese smoked “a third of the world’s total.” What led to this? Unlike other regimes from the late Ming to the early Republican era, the CCP mounted no prohibition campaigns against tobacco, nor did it have any guideline on its consumption; it remained quiet about smoking. This article turns to alternative evidence—propagandistic art, children’s pictorials, and cigarette packs—to demonstrate how cigarette smoking was portrayed and communicated, and how this material might have contributed to the explosion of consumption in the Mao and immediate post-Mao eras. More than that, the article exposes why the regime left tobacco alone and argues that the CCP is a tobacco regime, as it used smoking to serve political ends. More than a generation was lost, not to revolution but to smoking."
"Brian Orend, War and Political Theory","Some social and economic problems do not gain broad awareness. Yet others become prominent (and perhaps are alleviated) in part because they successfully engage the wider citizenry. In this paper, we investigate how the evidence used to describe problems affects public engagement. Using disparities in access to affordable health care—a focal aspect of economic inequality in the United States—as our main issue, we conduct a series of field and survey experiments showing how some forms of evidence reduce attitudinal and behavioral engagement while other forms increase them. Our results challenge common arguments about political communication and behavior, while also shedding new light on a central question in the study of politics: What determines when citizens become concerned about a social problem?"
American Socialism and American Political Culture: Irving Howe’s Conciliation with (and Dissent from) Individualism,"The European Union is facing a new era of politicization. Populist parties across Europe have challenged its legitimacy and ever-expanding authority. While the European Union was designed to govern, rather than represent, that is no longer enough. Today there is an urgent need to build a culture of healthy electoral contestation that does not shy away from debate over the very real transfer of political authority that is occurring. Upgrading norms about democratic contestation, rather than doubling down on technocracy, is the only way to generate a more robust European identity, adjudicate what kind of Europe its citizens want, and repair Europe’s frayed social solidarity."
"Fantasy States: Nationalism, Intimacy, and Transgression in South African Women’s Political Memoirs","We study the political effects of mass emigration to the United States in the nineteenth century using data from Sweden. To instrument for total emigration over several decades, we exploit severe local frost shocks that sparked an initial wave of emigration, interacted with within-country travel costs. Our estimates show that emigration substantially increased the local demand for political change, as measured by labor movement membership, strike participation, and voting. Emigration also led to de facto political change, increasing welfare expenditures as well as the likelihood of adopting more inclusive political institutions."
"Revisiting Democratic Elitism: The Italian School of Elitism, American Political Science, and the Problem of Plutocracy","Home price subsidies are common in low- and middle-income countries. How do they affect an important input into local governance—namely, citizens’ propensity to make everyday demands or claims? I study the effects of a program in Mumbai, India, through an original survey of winners and nonwinners of program lotteries. Winning increases participants’ reported claims to improved services and knowledge of municipal government. It also changes policy preferences, even among those who rent out the homes. Transfers can thus generate active citizenship through many channels, including increased political capacity, improved perceptions of self-efficacy, expanded expectations of government, and changed motivations of recipients. They also create interest groups at the local level, where their actions can have both positive and negative externalities. The findings are among the first causally identified effects of policy on claim making; they add a new context and dependent variable to the literature on housing policy."
The Quality of Life Turn: The Measurement and Politics of Well-Being in the 1970s,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have recommended actions such as wearing masks and staying home to reduce infection rates and promote well-being. However, individual compliance requires sacrifice and has been inconsistent. These significant behavioral changes often conflict with other parts of consumers’ identities, including their political orientation. We investigate goal centrality—that is, considering a goal as a major part of the self-concept—and message alignment as easy-to-implement strategies to enhance compliance. In study 1, reflecting upon a goal to stay healthy as a central (vs. peripheral) component of the self positively influenced intentions and health-promoting behaviors for less conservative individuals. In study 2, we showed that politically aligned messaging increased fluency, bolstering intentions and compliance for both liberals and conservatives. Our findings reveal promising tools to promote compliance in the face of temptations; we discuss additional means for policy makers and other entities to foster community well-being."
Republican Institutionalism for a “Government of Laws”: The Polybian Political Science of John Adams,"At the time of this writing, COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide. Even though the United States became the epicenter of the pandemic in April 2020, partisan differences have been observed in terms of willingness to engage in coronavirus-prevention behaviors. Across four studies and an exploratory pilot study, we demonstrate that conservatives differ from liberals in their perceptions of preventive behaviors. Conservatives view preventative actions as being less impactful on others, which is partially due to their beliefs regarding personal responsibility. Building on this, we also demonstrate the downstream benefits of using self-benefit versus other-benefit appeals to target conservatives versus liberals. In doing so, we show that communicating about self-benefits can minimize differences between conservatives and liberals in COVID-19 prevention-behavior compliance. This work contributes to the literature on political ideology and offers practical implications for policy makers and health organizations making every effort to encourage behaviors that prevent the spread of viral infections."
Business Lobbying within the Party-State: Embedding Lobbying and Political Co-optation in China,"This previously unpublished transcript of an undated and incomplete handwritten essay on surrealist doyen André Breton by American art critic Clement Greenberg is illuminating in terms of the otherwise somewhat oblique connection between politics and avant-garde art for the younger Greenberg, the precise nature of whose professed Marxism has long been contested. It was composed in response to Breton’s “Political Position of Surrealism” (1935). In his text, Greenberg argues that Breton is correct in his claim that radical artists should not let questions of politics distract them from autonomous work. However, unlike Breton, he does not contend that this is the case because such artists will be vindicated by future audiences and should, accordingly, work in defiance of a mass audience. Rather, Greenberg argues that no other mode of working opens up new fields of aesthetic experience while bemoaning the state of affairs where such art is inaccessible to the working class, ultimately calling for revolution to rectify the situation."
Tobacco Smoking and the Political Imagination during the Mao Era,"By referring to an elder brother of Saturn named “Titan,” Spenser’s Mutabilitie Cantos diverge from the Hesiodic account of the war between the Titans and the Olympians, to follow a lesser-known version originating in Euhemerus’ Sacred History and preserved because of the pivotal role it plays in Lactantius’ Divine Institutes. Spenser places his own sequel to the Titanomachy myth in the euhemerist tradition, which presents the Greek and Roman gods as mortal kings and queens, worshipped by their subjects, in order to satirize Hellenistic and imperial ruler-cults. Identifying Jupiter’s self-deification as the moment when the inseparable twins idolatry and tyranny were born, the Divine Institutes expound a Christianized version of Cicero’s law of nature to convict the Roman Empire of both impiety and inhumanity. Inspired by Lactantius, Spenser stages a trial in which the absolutist tendencies of Elizabeth and her probable successor are judged by the law of nature, embodied in the God-like Dame Nature. Holding the conflation of politics and theology up to skeptical scrutiny, Spenser uses Euhemerism to critique civil idolatry, in a way which counters the Eusebian currents in Elizabethan literature and influences Milton’s Paradise Lost.

"Political Issues, Evidence, and Citizen Engagement: The Case of Unequal Access to Affordable Health Care","The transcript published here for the first time is of Leo Strauss’s 1963 lecture on, and discussion of, the relation of religion to the commonweal in the tradition of political philosophy. In this lecture, Strauss considers the question of the establishment of religion, the relation of freedom of religion to freedom from religion, and the question of the truth of religion. The lecture has implications for American constitutional jurisprudence, especially concerning the First Amendment, which Strauss situates within the development of modern political philosophy."
When the Banal Becomes Political: The European Union in the Age of Populism,"An interview with Michel Foucault in 1979 that was never published during his lifetime and was recently rediscovered in the archives. The interview, appearing for the first time in English and in its complete form, marks one of Foucault’s final public discussions of the contentious topic of the Iranian Revolution. In particular, Foucault clarifies what he means by “political spirituality” and addresses the respective relations between religion, revolution, and self-transformation."
"Exit, Voice, and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States","This article identifies and critiques the continued use of political expulsion—or exile—in American communities. Expulsion, I contend, is boundary construction in the guise of punishment or harm prevention. While expulsion may appear at first glance to be deeply illiberal, it is an integral part of the liberal governing toolkit. Its persistence challenges commonly held beliefs about liberal-democratic citizenship being a secure status premised on the voluntariness of membership, toleration for a plurality of moral values, and state neutrality. I argue that we ought to recognize judicial banishment, expulsions rooted in the moral emotion of disgust, and the banishment of marginalized community members as being fundamentally exilic practices, despite the apparent banality that tends to depoliticize them. Decisions to expel outline what the expelling community deems unacceptable in a member and so offer a way of defining the conditions of belonging."
Home Price Subsidies Increase Local-Level Political Participation in Urban India,"Wendy S. Parker and I have advanced an inductive-risk approach to the provision of climate information that relies on the contextual values of information users. This approach aims to improve the effectiveness of climate information in social decision making. The approach’s emphasis on user values, however, conflicts with the so-called democratic view: if scientists employ contextual values, they ought to employ democratically endorsed values to preserve political legitimacy. This article draws on deliberative democratic theory to resolve the conflict, demonstrating that whether user values are legitimate to employ depends on the way labor is divided across deliberative moments."
Ask A Political Scientist: A Discussion with Imani Perry about Feminist Methods and Radical Politics,"State capacity is a core concept in political science research, and it is widely recognized that state institutions exert considerable influence on outcomes such as economic development, civil conflict, democratic consolidation, and international security. Yet researchers across these fields of inquiry face common problems involved in conceptualizing and measuring state capacity. In this article, we examine these conceptual issues, identify three core dimensions of state capacity, and develop the expectation that they are mutually supporting and interlinked. We then use Bayesian latent variable analysis to estimate state capacity at the conjunction of indicators related to these dimensions. We find strong interrelationships between the three dimensions and produce a new, general-purpose measure of state capacity with demonstrated validity for use in a wide range of empirical inquiries. It is hoped that this project will provide effective guidance and tools for researchers studying the causes and consequences of state capacity."
Collective Health versus Individual Freedom: Goal Centrality and Political Identity Shape COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors,"One of the defining characteristics of modern politics in the United States is the increasing nationalization of elite- and voter-level behavior. Relying on measures of electoral vote shares, previous research has found evidence indicating a significant amount of state-level nationalization. Using an alternative source of data—the political rhetoric used by mayors, state governors, and members of Congress on Twitter—we examine and compare the amount of between-office nationalization throughout the federal system. We find that gubernatorial rhetoric closely matches that of members of Congress, but that there are substantial differences in the topics and content of mayoral speech. These results suggest that, on average, American mayors have largely remained focused on their local mandate. More broadly, our findings suggest a limit to which American politics has become nationalized—in some cases, all politics remains local."
Political Ideology and the Perceived Impact of Coronavirus Prevention Behaviors for the Self and Others,"Public distrust in politicians is widespread across Western democracies. This general pattern suggests that the problem reflects dissatisfaction with not only government performance and misconduct—the main focus in existing research—but also how democratic politics is generally conducted. This article identifies a mismatch between the representation facilitated by modern democracies and the representation wanted by a majority of citizens. Because political representation is organized around cohesive parties, several institutions incentivize politicians to exhibit loyalty to party policy over other considerations (partisan representation). Observational and experimental data from three countries demonstrate that citizens generally perceive politicians as conducting partisan representation, but they prefer that politicians follow their own conscience (trustee representation) and constituency (delegate representation) over party policy. This mismatch translates into distrust in politicians, even in countries with strong norms for party discipline and among politicians’ own party supporters. The findings have implications for understanding and counteracting political distrust."
Greenberg’s Marxism: Clement Greenberg’s Unfinished Essay Draft on André Breton’s “Political Position of Surrealism” (1935),"Do redistributive policies intended to mitigate the costs of trade reduce protectionist backlash? To understand the link between policy making and the electoral consequences of policy outcomes, we address this question using data on redistributive assistance to workers harmed by trade liberalization. By analyzing the 2016 US presidential primary and general election results, we show these redistributive policy benefits are associated with reduced support for then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump, who ran on an antiglobalization platform. These findings suggest redistributive trade assistance may have a political impact by mitigating support for protectionist platforms and antiglobalization rhetoric of presidential candidates. Our results suggest that the redistributive program we examine in this article may accomplish one of its objectives: to make trade liberalization more politically palatable. This article extends findings in the extant literature on anti-incumbency effects to suggest that policy outcomes affect electoral support for candidates with antiglobalization platforms."
“Gods that faine to be”: Political Euhemerism in Spenser’s Mutabilitie Cantos,"This article explores the history of statistical knowledge about economic inequality in the United Kingdom in the latter half of the twentieth century. It presents a chronology of knowledge regimes that underwent several transformations from the postwar knowledge regime to the social-democratic knowledge regime in the mid-1970s to the neoliberal knowledge regime in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, it highlights the dominating position of civil servants and government statisticians in shaping official statistics that informed public debates, imaginations of society, and political decision making on issues of poverty, income, and wealth distribution. Methodologically, the article contends that the concept of knowledge regimes provides a useful analytical tool to investigate changing historical configurations of knowledge production. Analyzing knowledge regimes focuses attention on historical social orders, practices, norms, hierarchies of authority, and power relations that have bearing on the production and dissemination of knowledge. The article argues that developing the analytical tool kit will also help to build a more distinctive profile for the history of knowledge as a historical subdiscipline."
“Religion and the Commonweal in the Tradition of Political Philosophy”: An Unpublished Lecture by Leo Strauss,"Debates between realists and idealists in contemporary political theory have been confused by a tendency to conflate several distinct methodological theses. This article distinguishes between four dimensions of realism and shows how a novel reading of Hume’s politics can help us make sense of the importance of these theses and the relationships between them. More specifically, we argue that a theory we call normative conventionalism can be distilled from two of Hume’s more surprising and controversial essays, “The Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth” and “That Politics May Be Reduced to a Science.” This theory views norms and institutions as conventional solutions to problems of coordination and conflict that are historically contingent, but also provides us with an approach to gaining leverage on our practices so that we can say something about which norms and institutions are worth emulating."
"Political Realism in Apocalyptic Times, by Alison McQueen","Brand sincerity (wholesome, family-oriented) is a core dimension of brand personality; however, to what extent is LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) representation congruent with brand sincerity? We argue that whether or not LGBTQ representation is considered “wholesome” or “family-friendly,” and how consumers respond to such representation, is dependent on political ideology. Results show that an ad featuring a same-sex (vs. opposite-sex) couple is rated lower in brand sincerity by conservatives, which then uniquely predicts ad attitudes. Conservatives also saw a same-sex couple as more incongruent with a sincere brand, and this incongruence predicted ad attitudes. However, these effects were not found when the brand was exciting. Conversely, LGBTQ consumers’ preferred same-sex couple representation in the context of a sincere (vs. exciting) brand. Finally, an archival analysis of ads found that sincere (vs. exciting) brands represent LGBTQ consumers more favorably. Implications are discussed."
"William Anthony Hay, Lord Liverpool: A Political Life","Shaped by a host of antecedent factors, the Umbrella Movement in 2014 gave rise to a new political consciousness in Hong Kong’s civil society. The term “Umbrella Generation” has been widely used in the wake of the political struggle. This article takes the movement as a pivotal case study of the formation of a new political generation through the intersection of sociodemographic, political, and cultural changes. This entailed not only antistate opposition by citizens of that generation but also a process of generational change mediated by various contending forces. Considering both inter- and intragenerational dynamics, this article integrates the insights of generational theory with a cultural analysis of discourse and dramaturgy—the umbrella protests as street theater—as well as a political analysis of agency, conflict, and leadership shifts."
Political Spirituality as the Will for Alterity: An Interview with the Nouvel Observateur,"This essay addresses the COVID-19 pandemic as a moral, political, and cultural crisis. I argue that pandemics do not produce inequalities but rather that they reveal them and they put in sharp relief the work we still have to do as feminist scholars."
Exile in America: Political Expulsion and the Limits of Liberal Citizenship,"This article investigates the political roots of the global rise in corporate savings. In recent years, firms throughout advanced economies have started to accumulate enormous savings. Instead of using their revenues to reinvest or raise wages, many companies now stash their profits within financial markets, contributing to sluggish growth, financial fragilities, and rising inequality. I argue that political institutions that determine the balance of power between firms and employees play an important role in shaping this trend. The stronger unions are, the more they pressure firms into using revenues for pay increases and investment. The more unions’ influence erodes, the stronger the rise of savings. Using panel data from 25 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries as well as a regression discontinuity design leveraging the German law on codetermination, I find robust and causal evidence supporting this claim. These results have implications for our broader understanding of how political institutions affect financial imbalances and economic inequality."
Political Legitimacy in the Democratic View: The Case of Climate Services,"Examining two cases from twentieth-century US history, I explore feminists’ disengagement from electoral and party politics and its consequences. I argue that in these pivotal moments feminists largely ceded the terrain of electoral politics to their opponents and, in the breach, backlash thrived, reactionaries won power through elections, and antifeminists shaped the policy agenda at feminists’ expense. I conclude that to defeat backlash and advance a feminist future, feminists must build on women’s increased electoral participation post-2016 in order to elevate feminists to positions of power in the parties and the state."
Leviathan’s Latent Dimensions: Measuring State Capacity for Comparative Political Research,"Part I of this study, a survey of inmates in the Athenian prison, traces the emergence of imprisonment as a political weapon in periods of partisan tension, civil discord, and breakdown in intra-elite cooperation in classical Athens. Part II complements the aggregative and quantitative analysis of Part I with close readings of Athenian accounts of incarceration from the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. Athenian narratives of imprisonment reveal profound shifts in perceptions of the prison particularly in response to the undemocratic regimes of 411/10 BCE and 404/3 BCE. Early and mid-fifth-century authors often portray imprisonment as a mechanism of democratic self-governance, a judicial procedure used (and abused) by the dêmos and its leaders to check antidemocratic factions, seeking to destabilize popular rule. Post-404/3 BCE narratives of imprisonment, by contrast, represent the prison as coopted by elites hostile to democracy in Athens and abroad, and emblematic of antidemocratic subversion, oligarchy, and tyrannical ambition. The conclusion attempts to reconcile ancient perceptions of the prison as a political institution with the conventional tripartite classification of Athenian imprisonment as custodial, coercive, and punitive."
All (Mayoral) Politics Is Local?,"In 1898, the Chinese reformer, journalist, and political thinker Liang Qichao 梁啓超 (1873–1929) made Aristotle’s political thought available to his countrymen for the first time in China’s long history. Liang’s essay “The Political Theory of Aristotle” has never been available in English, leaving most scholars who are interested in the history of Chinese political thought unable to access what one of the earliest Chinese political reformers chose to say about a philosopher he believed to be the source of Western politics. This contribution includes an introduction by Shadi Bartsch that sets the scene for the first English translation of “The Political Theory of Aristotle,” Liang’s explication and commentary on Aristotle’s Politics."
"Presidential Leadership in Political Time, edited by Stephen Skowronek","The women’s liberation movement hotly debated both the cause of women’s oppression and the best approach to changing it. When treated as a moment within 1960s political polarization, these debates can seem esoteric and arbitrary. When examined across the longue durée, the debates prove to reflect complex and stable differences in interpretation that were tied to place more than to the political moment. Using a combination of network analysis, computational text analysis, and qualitative interpretation, the author examines women’s movement discourses across the first and second waves of activism and between two sites, New York City and Chicago. Place, she finds, serves to capture differences in political logics that generate durable differences within movement discourse."
Politicians as Party Hacks: Party Loyalty and Public Distrust in Politicians,"Risk carries unique significance for democratic politics today as it faces the challenges of rising inequality, neoliberalism, and systemic racism. To show how, the article divides “risk” into two complementary political models: a technocratic logic of risk allocation, concerned primarily with safety, and a forensic logic of risk attribution, concerned with holding risk takers to account. Both have had pervasive effects on a transformed welfare state, increasingly focused on “personal responsibility” and privatized risk-management. But risk has also played a key role in the way post-1968 movements have organized and challenged the logic of privatization. Risk-based movements, the article argues, especially from the political margins, are key agents in promoting a new political form founded on risk attribution. The article focuses on the exemplary case of the American environmental justice movement in the 1980s–90s as it reframed social justice around three core demands: accountability from decision makers, equitable risk distribution, and broad participation in decisions about danger and communities’ well-being."
Trump and Trade: Protectionist Politics and Redistributive Policy,"Anthropological fieldwork entails unforeseen details and raises unanticipated issues. My dissertation research in the mid-1970s explored the organization of work among Quechua Andean migrants cultivating coca in the Amazonian forests of eastern Bolivia. I collected too much information to process all that was relevant (omissions) and had to avoid reporting potentially harmful data (silences), especially given the expanding cocaine traffic beyond the community. Beginning in 1993, my next research project in a Costa Rican ceramic artisan community involved less analysis of aggregate data (omissions) and a greater emphasis on individual actors. This required discretion in reporting on conflicts (silences), especially concerning struggles to create an ecomuseum. Throughout long careers, changing anthropological orientations shape our choices about what and what not to pursue in the field and then recount. For me, an initial focus on human ecology expanded to include political economy and later also expressive culture, fostering a more holistic commitment."
Evolving Knowledge Regimes: Economic Inequality and the Politics of Statistics in the United Kingdom since the Postwar Era,"Up until the 1980s immigration-related subjects were largely ignored by comparative political scientists. It was only when they were politicized during the 1990s that political science scholarship on these subjects proliferated. The essays in this symposium expand upon the progress comparativists have made in comprehending and explaining the phenomena of mass immigration and immigrant settlement. Specifically, they explore several recent currents within their respective research streams, including issue salience, radical Right political parties, the domestic politics of immigration policy making, and national immigration regimes. All are intellectually indebted to the scholarship of Gary P. Freeman and Martin A. Schain to whom we dedicate this symposium."
Hume’s Politics and Four Dimensions of Realism,"We examine responses by Chinese firms to a party-building policy launched by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2015 to reform China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The policy requires SOEs to follow a model template of charter amendments to formalize and elevate the role of the CCP in their corporate governance. During the period 2015–18, about 10 percent of publicly traded SOEs failed to follow the mandatory policy, while nearly 6 percent of privately owned enterprises (POEs) complied even though they were not subject to the policy. We find wide variation in the provisions adopted within and across ownership types, with SOE adoptions apparently affected by their ownership structures and exposure to capital market forces and POE adoptions associated with political connections. Our findings highlight the complex contours of political conformity in Chinese firms and raise questions about the trajectory of Chinese corporate governance reform and foreign investment activity."
Diagnosing American Health Policy’s Many Maladies,"Countries around the world use various means to ensure that underrepresented groups gain legislative representation, including reserved seats and quotas for political party lists. Despite the fact that such measures are political interventions, the literature has mostly ignored their impact on electoral competition. We argue that reserved seats reduce the number of viable candidates and increase the extent to which competition revolves around major parties. Moreover, these effects should be most pronounced in lower-level elections, where candidates can more easily run outside major-party labels. Drawing on a rich collection of electoral data from India, we find that the effective number of candidates is lower in electoral districts with reservations, while vote shares for independent candidates are lower and vote shares for major parties are higher. These effects are largest in local elections and smallest in national elections."
The Art of Political Control in China by Daniel C. Mattingly,"Voters frequently use demographic characteristics such as race or gender as shortcuts when evaluating politicians. We use two survey experiments to show that candidates’ gender identity (specifically whether they identify as the same gender as the sex they were assigned at birth) functions as a similar cue. When a news story identified candidates as transgender, respondents rated them as more liberal and less likely to represent them, and less likely to receive their vote. The overall electoral penalty is moderated by voters’ party, ideology, religiosity, and authoritarianism. In contrast to research on other demographic cues, we find that these effects persist even in the presence of cues about the candidate’s party, suggesting that voters infer substantial information from politicians’ gender identity."
The Social Consequences of Political Anger,"While market-based climate policy in the United States has been dominated by emissions           trading, including policies at the state level and in proposed major federal legislation,           a number of recent U.S. climate proposals focus on a carbon tax (or fee). Just as           emissions trading programs have included some form of “price containment” measures, carbon           tax policies may include “emissions assurance” provisions or, as we refer to them here,           “environmental integrity mechanisms” (EIMs), which are designed to provide greater           certainty about the resulting quantity of emissions. We propose three political economy           reasons—as well as one practical reason relating to international climate agreements—that           EIMs are likely to be an important component of any politically successful carbon tax (or           fee) legislation in the U.S. Congress."
"How Do Electoral Quotas Influence Political Competition? Evidence from Municipal, State, and National Elections in India","A moral crisis can be personal, collective, or national. It is the perception of a critical accumulation of attitudinal changes that disrupt preexisting ethical norms and behavior. Most public perceptions of a moral crisis are not shared by all the people in a society, and the contents of moral crises also shift over time due to ongoing changes in social conditions and subjective perspectives. The differences, tensions, and conflicts underpinning recurrent public discourses over morality constitute the politics of moral crisis. This article first sketches the social conditions and moral premises in the 1970s that set the stage for radical changes in attitudinal perspectives in the post-Mao era, examines in particular the value shift toward a more individualistic morality in the 1980s, and contends that the Chinese understanding of Western individualism as a doctrine of egotism helped plant the seeds of public perceptions of moral crisis. The final section unpacks five perceived types of moral crises and points out the politics in each, highlighting the centrally important role of the Party-state in shaping China’s moral landscape. An examination of these moral crises provides a unique angle to understand the complexity of social transformation and political constraints in post-Mao China."
Gender Identity as a Political Cue: Voter Responses to Transgender Candidates,"Edmund Burke is commonly understood as having championed free markets, thereby revealing debts to his contemporary Adam Smith. Numerous scholars have identified a tension between this aspect of Burke’s thinking and his politics of tradition and conservation. This article argues that this reading of Burke is untenable because it relates Burke and Smith in doctrinal terms, at the cost of ignoring the divergent ways in which they constructed their arguments. Once this phenomenon is brought to view, the supposed contradiction in Burke’s thought dissolves: Burke’s so-called political economy was just as indebted to common-law legal thought as was his thinking on government. Thus, instead of construing phenomena such as wages in relation to price-setting markets, Burke described wages as determined by time and convention, the same forces at the center of his account of political institutions. The recovery of abstraction as an object of study may lead to a general revision of the historiography of political economy, not least because its status was contested then and remains so now."
The Political Economy of Hybrid Approaches to a U.S. Carbon Tax: A Perspective from the Policy World,"This article examines the politics of translation in Iran in order to contribute to a debate in anthropology around cultural difference and epistemic violence. It does so through a critical exposition of the forced confession of an Iranian politician, Saeed Hajjarian, who testified that his translation of European concepts into an Islamic idiom was responsible for unrest in Iran. It locates Hajjarian’s confession within Iranian histories of anti-Western politics and an Islamic discourse of learned judgement. It argues that the enactment of the Islamic state is mediated by the translation of the West and proposes that protests manifest as a problem of incommensurability for the Islamic state analogous to the problem of incommensurability in cultural anthropology. In attempting to sequester the Islamic Republic from the West, state officials reproduce sectarianism domestically. Anthropology risks the same when it attempts to insulate the non-West from Western epistemologies and ontologies."
The Politics of Moral Crisis in Contemporary China,"How are bureaucrats controlled by their superiors in the Chinese political system? “Leading small groups” (领导小组) are among the most important mechanisms for integrating the interests and opinions of various government and Party departments so that superiors can ensure that their policies are implemented. This article analyzes the roles of the three main actors in the leading small groups: group leaders, the heads of the lead departments, and the office directors. We discuss how these individuals operate through formal institutional approaches and informal political channels. Group politics of this kind is moving China’s decision-making process toward “integrated fragmentation.” We conclude that compared with previous Chinese regimes, Xi Jinping is making greater use of leading small groups to promote further reforms and to practice individualized centralization."
Conservative Politics and Laissez-Faire Economics?: The Burke-Smith Problem Revisited,"Current observation of social media suggests the fusion of politics and information is possibly more pronounced in recent history than ever before. The turbulent sociopolitical ecosystem, exemplified by the Black Lives Matter movement, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 US presidential election, has dominated recent print and electronic media and highlighted the malleable nature of information. Ubiquitous social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have become the vehicles through which consumers of political information are gaining a practical understanding of the inseparable nature of politics and information. As a major provider and facilitator of access to information, libraries have been drawn into the ideological confrontation between the traditional concepts of information, truth, and access. This article presents an interdisciplinary mapping of the intersections of politics and information and establishes a foundation for understanding ways in which that convergence affects the roles, engagement, and responsibilities of libraries."
"The slip of a philosopher and the sinking of the ship: Translation, protest, and the Iranian travails of learned politics","This essay begins by juxtaposing two images of ethnic minorities in China: news photographs of ethnic minority representatives attending national political meetings and shots of large crowds at ethnic Miao festivals as seen in locally produced videos. Through this contrast, I investigate a series of interlocking concerns in the anthropology of crowds, festivals, and media publics by taking the mediation of ethnic Miao festival crowds as my analytical focus. I argue that the visual objectification of Miao festival crowds in local videos concretizes a distinctly ethnic public based on a body politics of presence. In this vernacular media form, presence illuminates a majority Miao world. Making sense of body politics and ethnic publics requires an expanded media ethnography that takes presence seriously as a potentially political intervention. Images of Miao festival crowds are therefore doubly significant: first, by contributing to future ethnic imaginaries (both emic and etic), and second, by visually privileging lateral solidarities within hierarchical state-led discourses. In this way, the anthropology of media can contribute to developing fresh perspectives on the relationship between a politics of representation and a politics of presence."
Undermining the Archive: On Art and Political Ecology,"Can feminists’ complaints be voiced such that they participate in transforming that of which they complain? Or is complaining what feminists cannot but do in a constitutively masculine public sphere, whose conventions distinguish and privilege men’s speech and work to keep “men’s speech” attached to men’s bodies? I argue that feminists’ efforts to “go public” on digital platforms have led to the development of practices of writing, reading, and engaging strangers that promise an affirmative response to my first question. I further argue that we may fail to see digital feminist counterpublicity as political and agentic, owing to an implicit and visceral attachment to an abstract masculine political subject. To make these arguments I first analyze how feminist scholars think about feminist complaint. I then reconstruct a history of feminists’ efforts to voice their complaints on Usenet, a formative precursor of today’s social media. Doing so allows me to elaborate the counterpublic world-building politics immanent in the communicative practice of many of today’s digital feminisms."
"Adam Kotsko, Neoliberalism’s Demons: On the Political Theology of Late Capital","This article charts a relational history of Palestinian and Israeli temporalities. Probing the interplay of political and cultural discourses, I show how while literature and film are indices of the temporal views that inform political action, they also work to expand those views. What are the key temporal concepts of Zionism and Palestinian thought, and how have they been negotiated in literary and cinematic works from the 1940s to the present? How have major political developments influenced temporal attitudes and cultural discourse? What emergent temporalities are at play in the current political climate? To address these questions, I bring insights from the social sciences into dialogue with close readings of Hebrew and Arabic works. After delineating what I call the syntagmatic model of Israeli and Palestinian temporalities, I discuss the fluid and nonlinear temporalities that are increasingly salient in Palestinian cultural production."
Integrated Fragmentation and the Role of Leading Small Groups in Chinese Politics,"European integration policies inflamed anti-Europe sentiments in Britain and exposed the fragility of democratic institutions in the face of populist campaigning. This article demonstrates how Europe became the focus of British anxiety about globalization and activated concerns for national sovereignty. Using the example of metrication in the 1970s, the article situates the abstract notions of globalization and sovereignty in material and everyday terms. The very processes that sought to reconcile the impossible trinity of globalization, national sovereignty, and popular politics resulted in institutionalizing and legitimizing the deep ambivalence of inching closer to Europe. Negotiating with Europe to water down harmonization actually stoked and kept alive the fundamental issues rather than resolving them. The history of British metrication serves as an example of the profound significance of discursive framing on shaping policy as well as outcomes. The messiness with which metrication was handled by successive governments shows how dangerously and easily the knowledge gap between experts and popular opinion could be exploited. Populist framing of technical issues of metrication distorted the complex realities of globalization, rendered the consequences of European standardization more real in everyday terms, and verbalized populist opinions that forging closer ties with Europe would be a threat to Britain’s parliamentary sovereignty. Harmonization policies also heightened debates about British identity and compelled the country to seek ways to coexist between two extreme visions, one of “Deep England” steeped in tradition and another of a modern “efficient” Britain based on technocratic values."
"Julian Hoppit, Britain’s Political Economies: Parliament and Economic Life, 1660–1800","How do political actors use rhetoric after an initial policy battle? We explore factors that lead Supreme Court justices to integrate disagreeable rhetoric into opinions. Although disagreeable language has negative consequences, we posit that justices pay this cost for issues with high personal significance. At the same time, we argue that integrating disagreeable rhetoric has a deleterious effect on the institution by reducing majority coalition size. Examining opinions from 1946 to 2011 using text-based measures of disagreeable rhetoric, we model the language of opinion writing as well as explore the consequences for coalition size. Our findings suggest serious implications for democratic institutions and political rhetoric."
"Judith Butler, The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind","In 1962, James Baldwin received a letter from Hannah Arendt in response to a recently published essay. It read: “In politics, love is a stranger… . Hatred and love belong together… . You can afford them only in private and, as a people, only so long as you are not free.” I use this letter as a point of departure to examine the productive similarities and differences between these two important theorists of love’s relationship to politics. Arendt provides crucial resources in understanding the dangers love can play in modern alienation. However, her alternative, a love of the world, is limited by her account of judgment. Baldwin’s ideal of love shows equal concern for the public world, but it elevates the role of feeling in judgment. This account of feeling, and the type of imagination that activates it, helps to realize a more inclusive political world, one where black lives matter."
Mapping Intersections of Politics and Information in Twenty-First-Century Cyberculture,"Egyptian pottery—like the pottery from most excavations—is often prized as a chronological indicator above all else. Pottery thus becomes reified into apparently standard corpora by period, an impression reinforced by ceramic comparison and cross-dating across sites. Using data from select contexts at one Egyptian settlement site (Elephantine Island) and one specific ceramic form (the bread mold), this article argues that such an approach oversimplifies the ceramic record, ignoring localizing tendencies, continuities between periods, and the entanglement of the material record with long-lived social structures and patterns. Elephantine bread molds show technological continuity and change that does not move in lockstep with greater political changes, thus providing a window into local systems and the value of a regional approach to ceramics."
"Joshua Parens, Leo Strauss and the Recovery of Medieval Political Philosophy","We examine gender differences in policy influence and advancement within the congressional office context using US Congress payroll system data between 2001 and 2014. We document how congressional careers share structural features with nonpolitical occupations with gender gaps. We find that women staffers experience slower promotion and less compensation than men at the same rank and that the gender gap is most salient for positions presenting the greatest structural challenges for women. However, these differences are shaped by the salience of gender equality issues within the office, varying by legislators’ party and gender and by the roles of other women within the office. Our analysis offers leverage for assessing previous explanations for women’s underrepresentation among policy makers, suggesting that electoral factors, supply lag, and institutional inertia do not solely account for gender differences. However, the political context mitigates gender disparity because of the salience of gender equality within the political workplace."
"Stephen B. Dobranski, ed., Political Turmoil: Early Modern British Literature in Transition, 1623–1660","Attempts to apply the methods and findings of The Authoritarian Personality to Chinese culture and politics reveal the limits of its cross-cultural reach. Additional qualms result from a consideration of the history of displacing the rhetoric of pathologization from medicine to psychology to society and finally to politics. Critical Theory’s warning against the subsumption of non-identical individuals under homogenizing categories is only partly answered by the claim that such a homogenization has already taken place in modern society. By labeling those whose politics we may disdain as suffering from personality disorders, we risk undermining any hope for the persuasive use of reason in a deliberative democracy. We also provide an exculpatory excuse for deeds that without being labeled a sign of pathology would be recognized in moral terms as simply evil."
"Race and the Making of American Political Science, by Jessica Blatt","This article seeks to analyze the cultural and political significance of soccer, popularly known as football, in Black diasporic communities in New York City, from 1928 to 1949. While the historical scholarship on African American and African Diasporic culture and history has ignored the centrality of soccer to Black life, this article situates soccer within a long tradition of Black athletic politics, particularly during the interwar period. Black soccer challenges the narratives of American exceptionalism and the ways the United States exploited Black athletes as representatives of racial progress and assimilation before and immediately following World War II. Focusing on the Falcon Athletic Club and, to a lesser extent, the Maroons Football Club, I hope to reveal the diasporic circuits and politics of Black soccer during the interwar years in New York."
"Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought, by Hüseyin Yılmaz","Do bipartisan contributions by corporations and trade associations reflect strategic considerations or ideological moderation? In this article, I leverage lobbying disclosures in Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin to provide a new measure of ideology that allows me to adjudicate between the two accounts. These states’ legislatures permit or require lobbyists to declare their principals’ positions on lobbied bills. I combine these data with roll call votes to estimate the ideal points of legislators and private interests in the same ideological space. I find that the revealed preferences of most corporations and trade groups are more conservative than what would be implied by their contribution behavior. This shows that a moderate contribution record need not imply moderation in policy preferences. Thus, such interests may not reduce polarization overall. Further, the divergence between contribution and position-taking behavior indicates that many business interests employ sophisticated strategies to influence public officials whom they disagree with."
"The Miao Festival Crowd: Mediations of Presence, Body Politics, and an Ethnic Public in “Minority” China","Governments around the world have privatized public services in the name of efficiency and citizen empowerment, but some argue that privatization could also affect citizen participation in democratic governance. We explore this possibility by estimating the impact of charter schools (which are publicly funded but privately operated) on school district elections. The analysis indicates that the enrollment of district students in charter schools reduced the number of votes cast in district school board contests and, correspondingly, reduced turnout in the odd-year elections in which those contests are held. This impact is concentrated in districts that serve low-achieving, impoverished, and minority students, leading to a modest decline in the share of voters in those districts who are black and who have children. There is little evidence that charter school expansion affected the outcomes of school board elections or turnout in other elections."
"S. T. Ambler, Bishops in the Political Community of England, 1213–1272","In recent years, historians have been recovering the stories of Black women radicals. Apart from their general orientation toward politics, two qualities distinguish these women: their internationalism, and their rebellion against bourgeois notions of respectability. This article intervenes in this discussion by examining key moments in the life of Goldie Watson, a onetime Communist and an elementary schoolteacher in Philadelphia from the 1930s to the 1960s. I argue that Watson’s commitment to teaching as a profession and her lack of concern with the African Diaspora signal a profound commitment to American political institutions. Her early work with Popular Front groups in Philadelphia in the 1930s, her postwar civil rights activism, her appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1954, and her subsequent litigation against the federal and municipal governments all demonstrate an essentially instrumental orientation toward American communism and a steady commitment not to rejecting bourgeois norms and institutions but to enlarging the space for African American freedom in the United States."
Complaint and the World-Building Politics of Feminist Moderation,"This article contends that in the period of his greatest political influence (1895–1905), Booker T. Washington called for a radical reimagining of American social and political life as a civilization characterized by reciprocity and equal dignity between the races. As this period corresponds with the nadir of black life in America, Washington has been derided as politically inept and his program of economic uplift has been condemned as miserably incapable of improving the condition of African Americans. These critiques have purchase, but fail to duly analyze the substance of Washington’s thinking. Examining Washington’s writing from this period for a political theory underlying his political program, I claim that these texts contain an internally coherent and often-attractive account of civilization comprised of black citizens who share equal social standing with white citizens, since all are industrious, confident, clean, and dignified. I argue that Washington’s object lessons contain examples of this dynamic of civilization and that Washington is part of a tradition of black political theory, which qualifies him as deserving of consideration as a political theorist on his own terms."
"Women’s Political Activism in Palestine: Peacebuilding, Resistance, and Survival by Sophie Richter-Devroe","Promised power, many people in our democratic age find their lives swept away by a factory owner’s signature or their way of life eradicated by military violence. Dashed hopes produce anxiety and despair. Cornel West puts it succinctly: “despair and hope are inseparable.” In this article, I argue that Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska explores the despair produced by the failure of hopeful agency and responds to that danger with a counterconception of agency (influenced by horror and sound) that conceives of a world in which objects actively participate. Ghostly sounds rise from earthy fields (as he sings on “My Father’s House”), calling to action with neither hope nor despair."
Temporalities of Israel/Palestine: Culture and Politics,"This reflection on Palestine’s political impasses in relation to the experiences of other colonized places and peoples was inspired by the current ferment in critical indigenous and native studies, and now Palestinian studies, about settler colonialism. Tracing the promises and pitfalls of new imaginations of sovereignty and self-determination emerging through indigenous activism, the essay reflects on museums and contested rituals of liberal recognition in North America and Australia to highlight both the stark differences in the situations of Palestinians under Israeli rule and the radical significance of the recent efflorescence of Palestinian cultural projects. Focusing particularly on the history of the Palestinian Museum (that opened in Birzeit in 2016), the article argues that the productivity of the settler-colonial framework lies less in the way it maps directly onto the situation on the ground than in the new solidarities it engenders and its potential to burst open the Palestinian political imagination."
"“Imperial Folly”: Metrication, Euroskepticism, and Popular Politics in Britain, 1965–1980","In four U.S. cities, contemporary activists commemorate dyke bars as a strategy for establishing social ties, rather than political mobilization, with other gender and sexual minorities without replicating past exclusions. Activists aim to accomplish their goal by centering two frames: “critical nostalgia” for lost bars and presenting bars and the dyke-dense neighborhoods that housed them as casualties of gentrification. By deploying critical nostalgia, commemorators distance themselves from lesbian identity politics and present that politics as a shared, if problematic, lineage that unites diverse LBTQ+ individuals. They rely on gentrification to construct a new, shared vulnerability that creates a general sense of “us” versus “them.” The article documents the process via which earlier movement frames and identities are abstracted to solve contemporary problems, demonstrates how reliance on an amorphous threat facilitates a coalitional response that does not require explicit boundary marking, and underlines how memory aids efforts to form ties."
Reading Regents and the Political Significance of Law,"On the basis of fieldwork in Kinshasa, this essay makes a link between riots, the recent anthropology of “surplus populations,” and distributive politics in low-income countries, especially Africa. Tracing the history of a political demonstration turned riot, it shows how distribution structures the interactions between rich and poor in the city. Situating the riot in a context in which subjects are dependent on the market for goods but are not able to sell their labor, the essay shows the riot to be a rational intervention in a place where elites do not see popular support as especially important and where occupying space and controlling circulation and distribution are the primary political-economic imperatives."
Crisis! When Political Parties Lose the Consent to Rule by Cedric de Leon,"In Bulgaria, the Rom/Ciganin persona is defined by non-Ciganin Bulgarians as a set of reiterated features, displayed as fixed and supposedly identifiable by all. This persona is enregistered through various semiotic processes, television being one of the most important ones. Rom/Ciganin is the name that links together a set of indexical stereotypes (naturalized as essences) and purports to denote a particular referent, a community, an ethnicity, and the individuals who, by being so labeled, are said to belong to it. Through the study of a racist act of aggression filmed in Bulgaria, I hypothesize that the hatred of Cigani passes discursively through a typification constantly reelaborated by a process of enregisterment. The making of peoples, groups, and communities is not new, but it becomes problematic when researchers, and the institution in general, relay the idea of fixed ethnic categories without problematizing them. They thus legitimize the Roma (or Cigani, Gypsies, etc.) category, and indeed the Rom persona, through the (re)production of a set of political discourses based on ethnicity and discrimination. This legitimizes a category that allows the marginalization and exclusion of individuals and families in the name of their supposed membership."
"A Political Companion to W. E. B. Du Bois, edited by Nick Bromell","In this paper I examine how male soldiers perpetrate political violence against civilian men and women, at home in Zimbabwe and at the war front in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Zimbabwe it is widely believed that men are generally more aggressive than women, and that when trained as soldiers, men become more violent, particularly in the context of political violence and war. In this paper I assert that the “making” of soldiers is deliberately aimed at enhancing their masculine ability and skills to be violent against perceived enemies and also civilians. I raise the question whether political violence and war make men more violent or unleash a “natural” male violence. The paper argues that when soldiers are deployed to do the work of political violence and armed conflict, they develop a sense of pleasure when killing, a practice that is ingrained, promoted, and perpetuated by “military ideology” and “military mentality.” I assert that soldiers practice and consequently become imbued with a killer mindset at home, which they subsequently use or employ to the war front. I use ethnographic material: I was a soldier in the military, at home and in war. Data were drawn from former Zimbabwean soldiers and civilians, victims of political violence."
"The Sources and Consequences of Political Rhetoric: Issue Importance, Collegial Bargaining, and Disagreeable Rhetoric in Supreme Court Opinions","This article returns to the post–Civil War period to reconstruct Congressman Thaddeus Stevens’s political thought. Stevens argued that incorporating former slaves into republican society required a federal policy of land confiscation and redistribution in the South. According to the Republican congressman, taking land from the planter class, not just granting land to freed slaves, was a necessary component of any plan intended to break the slave power and inaugurate an interracial republic. My recovery of Stevens’s defense of land confiscation offers us critical purchase on contemporary demands for slave reparations. I compare the tenets of contemporary reparations discourse and Stevens’s efforts to form a true republic. Recovering Stevens’s bid orients us toward the potential uses and dangers of resurrecting a politics of Reconstruction premised on the active taking of material power from those who disproportionately wield it."
Party Politics and American Racial Orders,"Hume is widely believed to have held that constitutional stability depends entirely on institutional design predicated on the assumption that every person is a knave. His famous statement to this effect has been enormously influential, both historically and among contemporary scholars. Yet Hume did not in fact think that institutional design on the assumption of universal knavery was enough, if seeking to establish long-term constitutional order. This was due to the ongoing threat posed by faction and its capacity to subvert even the best-designed constitutions. The knave maxim was a necessary, yet not sufficient, condition for political stability. To see this, we must locate Hume’s knave maxim in the wider context of his critique of parties, and especially his narrative construction in the History of England, as well as his exploration of the limits of political science in “The Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth.”"
"Kathrin McCann, Anglo-Saxon Kingship and Political Power: Rex gratia Dei","This review essay considers two recent publications: David S. Brown’s The Last American Aristocrat: The Brilliant Life and Improbable Education of Henry Adams, and Ormond Seavey’s Henry Adams in Washington: Linking the Personal and Public Lives of America’s Man of Letters. Henry Adams was the descendant of two American presidents (John Adams and John Quincy Adams) and raised in the revolutionary atmosphere that continued to linger in New England at the time of Adams’s birth in 1838. Yet, by the time of his death in 1918, the republic that his great-grandfather helped to found had been transformed into a large, industrial democracy poised to become one of the twentieth century’s superpowers. Brown, a historian, and Seavey, a literary critic, offer insight into the remarkable life and works of a very private man from one of America’s most public families."
"Padraic Kenney, Dance in Chains: Political Imprisonment in the Modern World","The seemingly limitless amount of false information online, especially about important political and current events, has become an increasingly sizable problem for the health of democratic governance around the world, most especially in the realm of social media. Misinformation online now has significant tangible real-world impacts, with libraries being the best situated social institution to help prepare all users to identify misinformation and navigate through the online environments in which it lives. This article proposes the idea of lifelong information literacy—the teaching and reinforcing information literacy to all users at every opportunity. The constantly changing nature of misinformation online merits treating information literacy education as a continual process for all libraries. To maintain their long-cherished and hard-earned role as arsenals of democracy, libraries need to consider how to become arsenals of lifelong information literacy."
"Laura Slater, Art and Political Thought in Medieval England, c. 1150–1350","Empire building in Asiatic Russia in the late tsarist empire encompassed a complex set of measures. Yet its most fundamental component was about surveying and allotting land to both native residents and incoming settlers, a procedure called zemleustroistvo, or “land organization.” An 1896 law regulated this procedure in the four Siberian governorates. It was the Russian counterpart of a process common to other settler societies. Despite its technicalities, land surveying can be regarded as a point of intersection between political/intellectual and social history, the locus where political design met complicated social realities and tried to transform them, most often with mixed results. Rules about tracing spatial boundaries reflected ideas about the rational use of resources or about justice, as well as social and cultural hierarchies to be implemented. This essay examines what Siberian land organization was supposed to accomplish and why it was conceived in its particular form. Questions about legal title, survey scale, and allotment standards are discussed to attain a better understanding of the logic of imperial rule. Tsarist decision makers constructed a procedural framework marked by information deficiency, quantitative approximation, and administrative ambiguity. This approach was intentional and produced a fluid, semi-authoritarian, semi-negotiated dialectic of petitions and administrative responses. By 1905, however, the politics of spatial approximation showed its limits and gave way to perceptions of an increasing administrative impotence in managing population and resources. This helps explain the urgency of the mobilizing, technocratic effort that marked the final years before the First World War."
"Matthias Roick, Pontano’s Virtues: Aristotelian Moral and Political Thought in the Renaissance","When does a group of citizens influence public policy? Mainstream American politics research emphasizes the importance of the group’s presence in the electorate, while other scholars argue that group cohesiveness, organization, and nonvoting political activity are potentially more important. These two strands of the literature have largely developed in parallel, in part because they tend to employ different empirical methods. In this article, I attempt to bridge the divide between them and test these ideas within the same empirical framework, using senior citizens and senior-friendly transportation policy as a test case. My results show that senior voting does not unconditionally predict policies friendlier to seniors. Instead, I find that city policies are friendlier to seniors when seniors are a more cohesive, meaningful group and when they engage in activities other than voting. Moreover, when seniors are a cohesive group, their share of the electorate does matter for policy outcomes."
"Political Economy of China-Taiwan Relations: Origins and Development, by Chien-Kai Chen","The swift reception in Bulgaria of Bakhtin became embroiled in various strategies for opposing the prevalent dogmatic doctrine of the “theory of reflection.” Structuralists were mistrustful of Bakhtin’s ideas, suspecting them of implied authoritarianism, while so-called impressionists took them in two diverging directions: one proto-post-structuralist, the other one rightist-nationalist and retro-utopian. Paradoxically, the last one was favored by the supposedly Marxist regime, which might provide a glimpse on the early etiology of present-day nationalism."
A Different Price for the Ticket: Hannah Arendt and James Baldwin on Love and Politics,UNESCO’s eight-volume General History of Africa (GHA) was a politically engaged but scholarly endeavor that aimed to Africanize the writing of African history. It did so partly through an expulsion of historical explanations that hinged on the idea that greatness had been transported into Africa from the outside. This article shows how the GHA developed scholarly standards while at the same time grappling with the political tension inherent in a move away from European colonialist historiography. It was specifically during the editing of the chapter written by Cheikh Anta Diop on the origins of the ancient Egyptians that political imperatives seemed to clash with standards of academic rigor and scholarly methods. This article offers an analysis of reports produced by the GHA during the editing of the series to show how the GHA navigated these tensions and why they chose to include the Diop chapter even if not all historians working on the GHA agreed with it. The article thereby shows how a decolonization of history took place in historiographical practice.

"From Immunity to Collaboration: Microbes, Waste, and Antitoxic Politics","In this paper I trace the emergence of a more-than-human antitoxic politics where microbes are cultivated agents of environmental remediation. Following a successful anti-incinerator protest, a group of urban waste activists in China turned to the brewing of eco-enzymes, a fermented solution made from organic waste, as a means of fortifying the health of bodies, homes, and their local environment. I illustrate how the material effects of microbes catalyze a grassroots response of experimental speculation among middle-class waste activists in response to China’s polluted environment. Following feminist science and technology studies scholars and the work of Roberto Esposito, I argue that eco-enzyme brewers engage in a microbiopolitics of immunity and collaboration to reconstitute human and nonhuman collectives in acts of cooperation and care for the environment. Eco-enzymes brewing illustrates how the uncertain effects of microbial transformation can sustain an experimental inquiry into the modes of ecological action that are possible under China’s authoritarian politics and polluted landscape."

I analyze a formal model in which states may form coalitions for war but are uncertain about a partner’s willingness to fight. I demonstrate that incentives to lie are greatest when potential coalition partners agree on how to settle a dispute. Additionally, the audience of communication matters. Communication among military partners is only credible when it occurs in private, out of view of a shared enemy. Taken together, the results indicate that preference heterogeneity and secrecy are necessary for credible communication among military partners. In an extension, I show that the availability of side payments exacerbates the difficulty of communication. The theoretical results provide a framework to understand observed variation in the success of precrisis diplomacy among potential coalition members."
“Jesus Saved an Ex-Con”: Political Activism and Redemption after Incarceration by Edward Orozco Flores,"In this article, I turn to a late nineteenth-century Ottoman-Muslim women’s periodical, Hanımlara Mahsus Gazete (Ladies’ own gazette) to broaden the scope of transnational feminist genealogies of women’s piety, agency, and political subjectivity. I argue that the writers and editors of the gazette, who were mostly Ottoman-Muslim women, illustrate the subject position of nonpious believers. This position encapsulates the ethical and political imperatives of a subjectivity that is neither emancipatory nor exclusionary for women. Situating the gazette in its local and transnational historical context, I examine a series of articles on women’s public schooling that merge the traditional demands of Ottoman society with demands for Muslim women’s public education. These articles illustrate an approach to religion and religiosity that prioritizes women’s public, collective, and political engagement, which requires a rethinking of the conceptual relationship between political action and religious belief. In dialogue with contemporary scholarship on women’s piety and agency, I show how Ottoman-Muslim women’s rediscovery and reevaluation of their own religion was articulated as a fundamental necessity for crafting a new kind of public space, one in which women are recognized as rightful members of the politico-religious community. While this may seem like a merely strategic, or instrumental, use of religion, what distinguishes this periodical’s turn to Islam is its contributors’ simultaneous commitment to following religious precepts and to unearthing these precepts’ potential for enabling women’s inclusion in the life of the politico-religious community."
"Dmitry Shumsky, Beyond the Nation-State: The Zionist Political Imagination from Pinsker to Ben-Gurion","Property titling enables tax collection and encourages private investment. Yet, governments across the developing world often fail to invest in land registration systems, such as cadastral maps, that record land ownership and values. In this paper, we describe and estimate the fiscal benefits and political costs that elected officials face when deciding whether to invest in this critical fiscal infrastructure. Focusing on Brazilian municipalities, we find that property tax revenue increases by over 10% following cadastre updates. Officials covet this revenue, but they simultaneously seek to secure their reelection, and investing in the cadastre can generate political costs by angering tax-averse voters or undermining clientelism. When these political costs are large, officials who do not face reelection pressures have greater incentives to invest in the cadastre. Using a close-election regression discontinuity, we find that term-limited incumbents are around 15 percentage points more likely to update the cadastre."
International Water Scarcity and Variability: Managing Resource Use across Political Boundaries by Shlomi Dinar and Ariel Dinar,"Settlement of high-stakes investor-state disputes may expose respondent state governments to public criticism for allegedly capitulating to foreign investors and large corporations, which gives rise to domestic-audience costs in the form of lower support for respondent state governments. The anticipated domestic-audience costs may in turn constrain states’ settlement behavior. Using the time left until the next election in the respondent state as a proxy for the size of anticipated domestic-audience costs, I find evidence that the probability of settlement decreases as elections approach in respondent states. This pattern appears to hold for both democracies and nondemocracies that hold elections. The findings suggest that pressure from domestic constituents causes respondent state governments to change their settlement behavior by not settling cases they otherwise would have settled or delaying settlement. These findings reveal potential inefficiencies arising from domestic political influences on states’ settlement behavior."
"In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy, by Katrina Forrester","This article analyzes the relationship between media, fire ecology, and Indigenous fire management in the context of Australia’s catastrophic fire events of 2020. How might ethnographic attention to fire’s mediatization allow us to apprehend the distinctive sociality of fire’s qualia? What kind of witness might fire offer in a moment when its capacities as a medium underwrite the science, politics, and aesthetics of its apprehension? As fire is produced, scaled, and animated for screens, social media platforms, and the columns of the daily press, as well as for the ledgers, satellite maps, and fiscal calculus of carbon exchange, it has also acquired distinctive properties that trouble its capacity to bear witness to a climate in transition."
"The Drum Major Instinct: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Theory of Political Service, by Justin Rose","The 2015 release of Harper Lee’s novel Go Set a Watchman led to a frenzied reaction from admirers of To Kill a Mockingbird. This rush to decipher Atticus’s racial attitudes overshadowed Lee’s full unveiling of important new dimensions in the Finch family tale. First and foremost, the heart of both novels is the moral and political development of Jean Louise “Scout” Finch. Scout’s complicated education in civic, moral, and legal virtue requires readers to make sense of Atticus as a teacher. His lessons on justice and his political actions in Watchman illuminate his jurisprudence in Mockingbird as within the rule of law and civil rights traditions of a jurist such as Hugo Black. Finally, Watchman completes the arc of Jean Louise’s education by illustrating the dangerous consequences of political life without friendship. Read together, the novels offer a coherent and extraordinary commentary on American political life and thought."
Military Coalitions and the Politics of Information,"Scholars have long acknowledged that legislators strategically employ procedure to advance policy preferences. But evidence for this view is confined to the lawmaking process, omitting an essential function of elected representatives: oversight of executive policy making. We argue that ex post procedural oversight is also driven by policy disagreement. We demonstrate this by analyzing congressional participation in US Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking from 2007 to 2017. Using the content of public comments and commenters’ political contributions, our study is the first to locate the spatial position of rulemaking proposals. We find that the more ideologically distant the agency proposal, the more likely a request for documents, additional hearings, or more time for public participation. Moreover, these requests are likely to parallel substantive criticisms and be concentrated among members with experienced staff. These findings imply that—beyond setting the baseline rules of bureaucratic policy making—well-resourced elected officials leverage procedure during policy implementation."
"Sea and the Combat Myth: North West Semitic Political Mythology in the Hebrew Bible, by Joanna Töyräänvuori","This article reads Hobbes’s social contract through a monster genre lens, revealing the presence of an ancient narrative structure that deploys powerful symbolic forces. It argues that Hobbes creatively utilizes the monster genre’s mythic spatiality, linear trajectory, and subject positions—monster, victim, and hero—to compellingly present a fundamental problem plaguing humanity (wolfishness), as well as his political-theoretical solution (Leviathan). In this political monster tale, Leviathan, a heroic sovereign, conquers the wolf-man of the nightmarish state of nature, thereby making civil society possible. However, Hobbes potentially undercuts the success of his own political theory by framing his fellow citizens as monstrous wolf-men, and by associating his sovereign with a figure that, read mythically and symbolically, appears to be a complex hybrid that devours its subjects."
The Emergence of Desire: Notes Toward a Political History of the Will,"We estimate the effect of participation in a large antipoverty program in Colombia on turnout and electoral choice. Using variation in the proportion of beneficiaries across voting booths within a polling station and eligibility as an instrument for take-up, we find that in the 2010 presidential elections, enrolled women were more likely to vote and support the incumbent party candidate. Results for men are smaller and not always significant. Voters respond to targeted transfers, and women, as the direct recipients of the transfers, respond more strongly. Potential mechanisms explaining the results are civic engagement and gratitude toward the incumbent party."
Neither Emancipation nor Exclusion: Rethinking Politics of Piety through Hanımlara Mahsus Gazete,"I draw attention to a consistent but sometimes overlooked trait in John Donne’s sermons (delivered between 1615 and 1631): his effort to enumerate and defend the powers of preachers. Donne regularly emphasizes the preacher’s obligation to speak boldly to all members of the congregation and to set forth a message of repentance and consolation. This constant feature of Donne’s preaching, moreover, offers insight into his ambiguous political ideals. Donne cites the preacher’s duties in order to authorize his efforts to define England and its established church as privileged sites of honest counsel and amicable debate. He uses his visible, venerable position in the pulpit to recall and embody Christian humanist ideals of good advice and orderly dialogue, urging England to set aside factional strife at a time of increasing sectarian discord. Yet, while Donne powerfully articulates his vision, his idealism proves increasingly outmoded as the British Isles lurch toward the catastrophe of the Civil Wars. [J.W.]"
"Edward Hall, Value, Conflict, and Order: Berlin, Hampshire, Williams, and the Realist Revival in Political Theory","The Inter-American Human Rights System takes into account domestic political contexts in ways that sometimes have not been fully recognized. International human rights courts face a tension between the goal of expanding rights and the need to gain legitimacy with domestic constituencies. Cases involving national amnesty laws have posed this dilemma in acute fashion in the Inter-American System. An analysis of those cases and their domestic political contexts shows how the Commission and the Court have taken into account domestic circumstances, the first through the timing of referrals and the second through the Court’s jurisprudence."
"Eileen Hunt Botting, Mary Shelley and the Rights of the Child: Political Philosophy in “Frankenstein","In recent years, there has been an emerging theory of “student identity politics,” which focuses on student activism based on race, gender, and sexual identity. Thus far, scholars have not yet systematically extended the analysis of student identity politics to those student activism relating to territorial identity. The student-led territorial identity movement that began in Hong Kong in 2015, which has transformed the center-autonomy relations between Beijing and Hong Kong, offers a case study that enriches the theory of student identity politics by bringing in the notion of territorial identity and opening the door for future comparative studies of territorial identity movements worldwide."
The Face of Political Beliefs: Why Gender Matters for Electability,"International courts are increasingly affecting domestic and international politics and are receiving increased attention in political science research. In addition to their political importance, international courts provide new opportunities for testing theories of judicial politics, yet further progress requires access to data, particularly on the courts that have so far received less scrutiny. This article introduces a new database on Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) judgments. The database contains information on case proceedings, judicial behavior, judgment content, the actors involved, and compliance with remedial orders. The current version of the database contains data on 201 IACtHR cases. We illustrate how the database can be used to address important questions in judicial politics by analyzing whether the propensity of the IACtHR to rule against a responding state correlates with the positions taken by the same state early in the proceedings before the court. We find evidence of such a relationship."
"A History of Ottoman Political Thought up to the Early Nineteenth Century, by Marinos Sariyannis","If there is such a thing as a dominant public sphere in post-reform China, its emotional tonality has often been described as overwhelmingly positive, as evidenced by the recent focus on “happiness” campaigns or state-promoted “positive energy.” This special section takes the prevalence of positivity as an invitation to investigate its opposites: what, in an authoritarian context, is the political work of negative affects such as bitterness, fear, shame, indifference, deflation, or trouble? Locating the articles within a broader literature on affect and emotion in anthropology and beyond, this introduction provides an overall framing for the collection. Based on the articles, it depicts the potential of negativity as both disruptive and generative, as affects work through their evaluative and propositional force which induces transformation while often evading repression."
"Votes, Drugs, and Violence: The Political Logic of Criminal Wars in Mexico by Guillermo Trejo and Sandra Ley","This article explores media constructions of the 2007 murder of a Canadian teenager named Aqsa Parvez as a case of an honor killing that shocked Canada. While much has been written about her story in the Canadian press, considerably less attention has been paid to the ways in which this murder resonated far beyond the borders of the Canadian state. This article thus traces the travels of the narrative of Aqsa Parvez’s murder from Canada to the United States and then to Israel in order to show not only how stories of death gain meaning but also how they make meaning by reproducing national boundaries and by reconfiguring relations of dominance, resistance, and power. By charting the transnational routes of honor-related violence as they are exemplified in the Aqsa Parvez murder, the narratives or stories it generated, and the right-wing activism it mobilized, I aim to reveal connections between the discursive and political configurations of this crime. In mapping these stories’ movements and travels, as well as their tensions and contradictions, I show how the murder of (certain) Muslim women in crimes that become known as honor crimes is interpreted and deployed in a number of interconnected geopolitical sites and registers. Utilizing critical race and queer scholarship on the phenomenon and practices of pinkwashing, I argue that the production and commemoration of the honor crime as an instance of exceptional violence help authorize posthumous solidarities that serve to buttress right-wing forms of political activism."
"The Political Poetess: Victorian Femininity, Race, and the Legacy of Separate Spheres by Tricia Lootens","The production of policy knowledge in the United States is typically described as fractured and contentious. Yet since 1974, the production of fiscal knowledge in the federal budget process has become more centralized and coordinated. And even as Congress has retrenched other analytic institutions, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has endured. Dominant explanations for the CBO’s durability point to its reputation for neutral competence. This argument, however, fails to acknowledge that Congress has retrenched other institutions with similar reputations. Drawing on theories of policy durability and change, I argue that the CBO’s endurance has depended on the existence of a political support structure and growing congressional investments in fiscal knowledge. As these changes created barriers to formal retrenchment, critics of the CBO have embraced “technopolitical” strategies for altering its analyses or undermining its credibility. I conclude by considering the implications of these findings for what we know about the durability of policy-analytic institutions."
"Formal Models in Political Science: Conceptual, Not Empirical","County governments are a crucial component of the fabric of American democracy. Yet there has been almost no previous research on the policy effects of the partisan composition of county governments. Most counties in the United States have small legislatures, usually called commissions or councils, that set their budgets and other policies. In this study, we examine whether counties with Democratic legislators spend more than counties with Republican ones. We assemble an original data set of 10,708 elections in approximately 298 medium and large counties over the past 25 years. Based on a regression discontinuity design, we find that electing a Democratic legislator rather than a Republican one leads the average county to increase spending by about 5%. Overall, our findings contribute to a growing literature on the policy consequences of partisan control of state and local government. They show that the partisan selection of county legislators has important policy effects in county governments."
A Royal Accident: Medical Authority and Political Dynamics in 1559,"The article discusses Lebanese Marxist philosopher Mahdi Amel’s formulation of the concept of “colonial mode of production” as a differential mode from capitalism that is linked to it through “structural causality.” Amel theorized the colonial mode of production as a singular mode that was seen to be specific to some social formations like Lebanon, Algeria, and Egypt. The article draws out the Althusserian influences in Amel’s theoretical work and explains the contours of his main argument to show how the colonial mode of production was employed as a critique of national liberation movements in the 1970s. In his theoretical works, Amel also provides a substantive critique of structuralism by arguing for a notion of political practice as the determinant of social struggle in the last instance."
"Avner de-Shalit, Cities and Immigration: Political and Moral Dilemmas in the New Era of Migration","In this paper, we argue that the trial scene in Aischylos’ Eumenides exhibits attempts at “internal critique,” that is, arguments refuting a thesis “from within,” for example, by identifying a logical inconsistency. Apollo, Orestes, and the Erinyes employ such techniques with varying success in three argumentative moves pertaining to murder, revenge, and kinship, thus showing and teaching the audience the art of such argument. While these techniques are typically considered Socratic-Platonic, we argue that this is a decisive moment in the history of argumentation, and possibly the first juncture in extant Greek literature where a character explicitly points out a contradiction."
The Politics of Property Taxation: Fiscal Infrastructure and Electoral Incentives in Brazil,"A large theoretical literature in sociology connects increases in incarceration to contractions in the demand for labor. But previous research on how the labor market affects incarceration is often functionalist and seldom causal. This article estimates the effect of a shock to the southern agricultural labor market during a time when planters exerted a clear influence over whether workers or potential workers were incarcerated. From 1915 to 1920, a beetle called the boll weevil spread across the state of Georgia, causing cotton yields and the demand for agricultural workers to fall. Using archival records of incarceration in Georgia, the authors find that the boll weevil infestation increased the Black prison admission rate for property crimes by more than a third. The article describes the institutional conditions under which falling labor demand should increase incarceration, clarifies the relationship between incarceration and the economic institutions that replaced slavery, and contributes to a growing literature on incarceration and exploitation in the labor market."
Domestic Politics and Settlement in Investor-State Arbitration,"This article traces the relationship between neoliberal thought and neural networks through the work of Friedrich Hayek, Donald O. Hebb, and Frank Rosenblatt. For all three, networked systems could accomplish acts of evolution, change, and learning impossible for individual neurons or subjects—minds, machines, and economies could therefore all autonomously evolve and adapt without government. These three figures, I argue, were also symptoms of a broader reconceptualization of reason, decision making, and “freedom” in relation to the state and technology that occurred throughout the 1950s–1970s. I also argue that this genealogy of decision-making underpins contemporary relations between machine learning, reactionary politics, and neoliberal economics."
"Smoke’s screens: Media, fire, and the politics of apprehension","American politics in the age of Donald Trump is characterized by negative affect toward politicians of the opposing party and a willingness on the part of citizens to forgive most sins of copartisans. Against this backdrop, we ask whether Trump’s numerous high-profile reversals on foreign policy issues matter. Given our polarized political environment, we argue that there is little reason for Trump to worry about looking inconsistent. Drawing on prior scholarship, we contend that when citizens evaluate a leader who has reversed, policy preferences will supersede any consideration of a flip-flop. We also argue that partisan motivated reasoning and preexisting attitudes toward Trump will overwhelm the impact of a reversal on most matters of foreign policy. Using two survey experiments that reflect real-world events, we show that citizens do not change their attitudes toward Donald Trump significantly even when his policy reversals are made explicit."
Development after Statism: Industrial Firms and the Political Economy of South Asia by Adnan Naseemullah,"All supreme CCP leaders encounter an inherent contradiction between maintaining a necessary level of power sharing (collective leadership) while ensuring their own effective control over overall Party politics. This article uses case studies of the formation of the Eighteenth and the Nineteenth Central Military Commissions, as well as of the Nineteenth Politburo Standing Committee, to decipher how Xi Jinping has handled the contradiction by establishing his personal domination while attaining a degree of subtle grouping balance in the CCP/PLA leadership."
To Fulfill These Rights: Political Struggle over Affirmative Action and Open Admissions by Amaka Okechukwu,"Preserving national unity in light of diversity—e pluribus unum—is a challenge in immigrant-receiving nations like the United States We claim that endorsement of this view is structured by the varied bond between ethnic and national identity among immigrant minorities and native majorities, a proposition we test across three studies of US Latinos and whites. Study 1 uses national survey data to show that ethnic and national identity are associated with support for this objective, though in varied ways, among these groups. Studies 2 and 3 sharpen these results experimentally by illuminating the role of elite rhetoric in forging these connections. We show that elite remarks about the (in-)compatibility of ethnic and national identity motivate support for e pluribus unum through the specific attachment it influences. That is, elite rhetoric causes shifts in ethnic or national identity, which then asymmetrically shapes support for e pluribus unum among Latinos and whites."
"Afterlives of Chinese Communism: Political Concepts from Mao to Xi, edited by Christian Sorace, Ivan Franceschini, and Nicolas Loubere","While menstrual activism has a robust history rooted in feminist ideals of bodily autonomy and anticonsumerism, its current iterations prioritize an anemic view of menstruation that grounds it in a neoliberal politics of respectability. As it stands now, menstrual activism has too often taken up menstrual products as the answer to “solving” menstrual stigma throughout the world while making invisible other aspects of the politics of menstruation (e.g., the importance of bodily rebellion, the perils of trans menstruation). In short, even though there are clear merits to providing menstrual products to those in need, the material focus of today’s menstrual activism has ultimately and ironically moved menstruation out of public view. In this essay, we critically examine three framings used to conceptualize the urgency of menstrual activism: public health, the water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector of global development, and the menstrual equity/period poverty movement. Finding fault with each, we argue for a new vision of menstrual activism that prioritizes what we term “radical menstrual embodiment,” a more transgressively feminist approach to understanding stigma and the root causes of menstrual negativity alongside an invigorated connection between menstruation and fertility, sexuality, and gender. By moving away from the hazardous politics of respectability and its product-focused agenda, radical menstrual embodiment can differently engage with the public sphere as menstruation moves from sanitized, clean, and “proper” to messy, intersectional, and multifaceted."
Justice Finch: The Complicated Law and Politics of Harper Lee’s Atticus and Scout,"In the midst of the current global turn to the right, striking resonances across oceans emerge: strongmen and their allies point to specific and vivid tales or images signaling demographic shifts as signs of danger. These could be lesbian farmers (supposedly) staging a takeover of the US Midwest, tales of virtuous headscarf-wearing women under attack by secular men (in Turkey), or of Muslim Romeos luring Hindu women to convert (in India). In each of these cases, the story lodges in the body and takes on a life of its own, inspiring fear and devotion, and centering the need for a heroic rescue. Here, we argue for the need for feminist engagement with political narratives about population change and point to the important work that fantastical stories focused on demographically based fears have done for the recent rise of right-wing politics in the United States, India, and Turkey. We refer to these stories as demographic fever dreams to emphasize their simultaneous obsession with demography and detachment from demographic data. Our analysis shows that demographic fever dreams deploy gendered tropes to create a narrative of vulnerability for dominant groups in relation to a takeover by religious, racial, and sexual others. Attending to the discursive constitution of demographic fever dreams in media and by political leaders in each context, we examine how they effectively invoke populist fears and identify which bodies become threatening and which ones need protection. We show that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Donald Trump in the United States, and Narendra Modi in India have all deployed an imaginary of an authentic nation under threat—whether that is racialized as the white working class in the United States or given religious inflection as authentically Sunni in Turkey and authentically Hindu in India. This imaginary becomes a fetishized group under threat from all manner of others threatening demographic destruction. In each of these instances, we argue that figures with political power use a vivid and fantastic fiction to amplify, imagine, and obscure demographic patterns of migration, birth, or mortality so as to consolidate political power or to dismiss and undermine class tensions and create fictitious communities of homogeneity. Thus, demographic fever dreams effectively produce a rationale for strongman masculinity and contribute to the retrenchment of nationalist values."
Under A Political Cloud: How Politicized Brands Shape Gift Appreciation,"This article examines how a state campaign against an unprecedented rise in drug and substance abuse became enmeshed in domestic politics characterized by interethnic rivalry due to the monopolization of patent medicine enterprises by migrants in Kano, the most populous state of Nigeria. In 2013, Kano ranked first in the hierarchy of drug and substance abuse because of poorly regulated patent medicine enterprises aggravated by the unscrupulous practices of some entrepreneurs. Using extant sources, this article explores and analyzes the degree of influence that domestic politics exercised in the campaign against drug and substance abuse in Kano from 1999 to 2016. The Kano state government-led campaign against new dimensions of drug and substance abuse worked through the exercise of effective control over patent medicine enterprises in Sabon Gari. This campaign was frustrated by politics, resistance, and litigation in ways that allowed the problem to persist."
"Noel Malcolm, Useful Enemies: Islam and the Ottoman Empire in Western Political Thought, 1450–1750","Scholarly debates over precarity are gaining unprecedented visibility across fields. From labor insecurity forming a growing dangerous class to the existential condition of vulnerability induced by millennial capitalism, precarity has become an object of both empirical study and theoretical reflection. While European social movements have been organizing and writing about precarity from the late 1970s to today, still, from the US perspective, the term precarity might be mistakenly taken as strictly a scholarly invention. “Precarious Writings” offers an important corrective to the ways that precarity has been taken up in anthropology and cognate disciplines, addressing the specific epistemological and political limitations of existing usages and returning the concept to its overlooked grassroots history in social movement struggles in southern Europe. By returning precarity to these activist roots, this paper makes the case for the recognition of social movements as knowledge producers as well as sources of theoretical insight and innovation in their own right. By failing to recognize precarity’s development within contentious struggles, scholarly uses miss how the activist notion enables identity reformulations toward a kind of “precarity pride.” That is, the politicization of insecurity has become a source for nurturing a fluid space of political creation."
How the Ultra-Rich Use Media Ownership as a Political Investment,"In the Chinese bureaucracy, where political imperatives for maintaining harmony require people to restrain negative affects, officials often express anger and aggression through silence, apathy, and other flat affects. Other times, overly positive speech that conforms to dominant party ideologies overrides negative affects, flattening officials’ emotions and stifling their own voices. Drawing on ethnographic research in a city of Shandong province, this article studies both responses as “bureaucratic shiyuzheng.” I resist linking shiyuzheng primarily to biomedical explanations, or to the stress and depression triggered by anti-corruption campaigns, and instead treat this phenomenon as an embodied and affective practice that generates space for discourse, psychosocial imagination, and quiet critique. I demonstrate that bureaucratic shiyuzheng is the effect of double silencing, partly imposed by binding bureaucratic structures and the government’s increasing constraints on speech/voice, partly emerging from officials themselves, who seek self-preservation and optimization of resources. Rather than direct resistance to such silencing conditions, people cultivate shiyuzheng as an important mode of social critique."
"A Political Economy of the United States, China, and India: Prosperity with Inequality, by Shalendra D. Sharma","This article discusses the persistent absence of a consensus on a script for the language of the Hmong, a kinship-based society of 5 million spread over the uplands of Southwest China and northern Indochina, with a vigorous diaspora in the West. In search of an explanation for this unusual situation, this article proposes a political reading inspired by James C. Scott’s 2009 book The Art of Not Being Governed. A particular focus is put on Scott’s claim of tactical rejection of literacy among upland groups of Asia. To set the scene, the case of the Hmong is briefly exposed before detailing the successive appearance of orthographies for their language(s) over one century. It is then argued that the lack of consensus on a common writing system might be a reflection of deeper political motives rather than merely the result of historical processes."
Congressional Oversight Revisited: Politics and Procedure in Agency Rulemaking,"In this meditation on Darlene Clark Hine’s field-defining article, I pose two provocations: First, contemporary black feminist historiographical questions about the archive have deep roots in Hine’s work on dissemblance. Second, Hine’s article emphasizes that black feminist historiographical work is necessarily an imaginative practice, one that merges the historical and the literary, the archival and the speculative, the documented and the elusive. It is the fact that black feminist historical work is necessarily speculative that explains why black feminist historical analyses have provided some of the most enduring concepts for black feminist theory, including dissemblance, critical fabulation, the politics of difference, and the politics of respectability."
"Eight Outcasts: Social and Political Marginalization in China under Mao, by Yang Kuisong, Gregor Benton, and Ye Zhen","In his role as consulting artist at the Hoover Dam, Allen Tupper True aimed to harmonize the monumental structure with its desert environment. To do so, he employed colors and patterns that he claimed to have abstracted from the traditions of local Native American tribes who had been displaced by dam construction. This essay uses True’s correspondence and design concept documentation, much of which is in the collection of the Archives of American Art, to analyze the entirety of his proposed decorative scheme for the dam and explore the ecological, aesthetic, and political implications of the project."
"Leonard Moore, The Defeat of Black Power: Civil Rights and the National Black Political Convention of 1972","Focusing on police chiefs in three states, this study revisits the Weberian presumption of the state’s monopoly on legitimate violence. Seventy-nine interviews with police chiefs in Arizona, Michigan, and California allow for an examination of their understanding of gun policy. Analysis reveals that they selectively embrace two frames of the state’s relationship with legitimate violence: gun militarism for criminal gun activity associated with black and brown communities and drug- and gang-related crime and gun populism with respect to lawfully gun-owning Americans, often marked as white and middle class. Sensitive to state-level sociolegal regimes, gun populism takes the form of antielitism in gun-restrictive California, crime-fighting by proxy in gun-permissive Michigan, and co-policing in gun-lax Arizona. The racial politics of legitimate violence intersect with state-level gun policies selectively to erode police chiefs’ investment in the state’s monopoly on violence, demonstrating that gun politics is pertinent not only for understanding violence in the United States but also for understanding the racial complexity of U.S. policing."
"Hobbes’s Social Contract as Monster Narrative: The Wolf-Man, Leviathan, and the Politics of Monstrosity","Through the case of salmon population science in the Columbia River Basin, this article explores how political mobilizations can sometimes use quantitative analysis of populations in unexpected ways. In the Columbia River, both fish counting and such controversial concepts as carrying capacity have served as tools not only for conservation advocacy but also, at times, for probing histories of settler colonialism and building alliances across difference. By examining the unusual case of salmon tallying and research in this region, this article argues that while population biology has been repeatedly used within problematic and even violent state projects, in certain contexts it can also become a practice of multispecies noticing and a catalyst for new coalitions. Based on this example, the article raises broad questions about what renewed attention to population biology might contribute to the growing subfield of more-than-human anthropology. It argues that anthropologists have not paid enough attention to the possibilities for numbers and population concepts to positively contribute to movements for more livable worlds. In light of this example, this article aims to foster additional anthropological attention to the situated and context-specific politics of scientific practices and tools."
Comment on “Accuracy in Public Law Enforcement under Political Competition”,"This article explores the remaking of ideas of the “ordinary citizen” in India in the context of Hindu majoritarian politics and changing relationships between the state and private capital. Focusing on one of India’s largest privately developed townships, DLF City, which adjoins Delhi, the article explores the ways in which activities by middle- and upper middle-class residents of DLF City produce new narratives of “ordinariness.” Within them, socioeconomically privileged groups come to be represented as “the common people,” contesting the postcolonial state’s historical focus on the welfare of marginal populations. The article suggests that contemporary narratives of ordinariness in India require an understanding beyond its deployment in critical social science literature where it is posited as a politics of speaking truth to power. The appropriation of ordinariness by the privileged in the Indian context is part of a new politics of class, caste, and majoritarianism."
Madisonian “Paths of Innovation”: Michael Zuckert on the Political Science of James Madison,"Recent governments in Ecuador (2007–17) have achieved impressive improvements in education. Enrollments increased significantly, and Ecuador’s learning gains on regional tests from 2006 to 2013 were among the largest in the region. Ecuador’s recent PISA performance provides further confirmation of genuine progress in raising student learning. A central part of Ecuador’s strategy was the Correa government’s implementation—over strong union opposition—of major teacher policy reforms, especially higher standards for recruitment and regular evaluation of teacher performance. Among the political advantages favoring government reformers were strong public support, sustained presidential engagement, and continuity in the government reform team. Ecuador’s experience offers lessons for improving education by raising the quality of teaching and supports theories on the role of policy entrepreneurs and veto points (with some modification) as core factors in effective education reform but provides little support for theories that highlight strong roles for civil society organizations."
"Cash and Ballots: Conditional Transfers, Political Participation, and Voting Behavior","For the Rage special issue, feminist and legal scholar Sarah Deer (Muscogee [Creek]), University Distinguished Professor at the University of Kansas, and Jodi A. Byrd (Chickasaw), associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, engage in a powerful roundtable conversation moderated by the Rage special issue editors Harvard feminist professor Durba Mitra and UCLA feminist professor Sarah Haley. In their rich exchange, we learn of the role of rage in Indigenous feminisms today. The roundtable explores critical issues for thinking the feminist, queer, and trans politics of rage among Indigenous communities—sexual violence, settler dispossession, the COVID-19 pandemic, racism, survival in the face of institutional and social violence, and the importance of Indigenous solidarity with social movements for Black lives in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020."
"Hans Jacob Orning, The Reality of the Fantastic: The Magical, Political and Social Universe of Late Medieval Saga Manuscripts","In his preface to Connecticut Yankee, Mark Twain declares that he will settle the issue of the divine right of kings in his next novel. That next novel is Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc. In a work that he called his “best,” Twain shows the difficulties besetting any effort to offer a rational justification of providential politics, such as is implied in the practice of the divine right of kings. And yet it prompts the reader to wonder if religious believers don’t also demand a church that understands its divine mission to consist in shaping the earthly lives of its adherents in terms they can understand. Twain’s Joan can exploit this particular difficulty because she locates its source in the human hope for a cosmic order upheld by a deity capable of correcting any evidence in nature, morality, or politics that might call such hoped-for order into question."
The Gospel of Joan: Statesmanship and Providential Politics in Mark Twain’s Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc,"This article examines the changing sociological meaning of indifference in urban China after the tragic death of a two-year-old girl in a road accident in 2011. My analysis suggests that, in China where the political state had tried to claim credit for all altruistic behaviors, anxiety about indifference allowed citizens to sidestep socialist ethics in conversations about civic mobilization. University students used the language of feeling and mourning to reinvent the protagonist, culprit, and victim in the accident, thereby developing new rationales for committing good deeds without acknowledging the moral leadership of the state. As opposed to the standard association of indifference with civic disengagement and social disintegration, this article suggests that indifference has civic potential to connect. Like skepticism, cynicism, and disappointment that people might develop in response to the genre of socialist heroism, indifference could anchor civic articulation of alternative futures that were yet to take shape."
Politics of indifference: Mourning Wang Yue in late-socialist China,"Widespread reliance on credit increasingly defines realities of economic citizenship in American society. This article theorizes the racial politics of credit expansion. It examines the federal initiative in the 1960s and ’70s to broaden financial access for poor renters in communities of color, which unintentionally sparked the rise of new state-level credit agencies. Drawing on historical evidence, much of it never used before, the author’s findings reveal the contentious politics at the heart of this policy shift. Doing so highlights the constitutive whiteness of credit and also illuminates how the project of expanding credit to marginalized groups tests the categorical seams of markets in the public imagination: such initiatives fuel racial contestation around taken-for-granted market rules, which draws governing officials toward increasingly speculative and convoluted financial instruments as a means of rule-bending subversion. Ultimately, this article sheds much-needed light on, and encourages further research into, the racial stratification of the state’s market-making power."
"Sharon E. J. Gerstel, ed., Viewing Greece: Cultural and Political Agency in the Medieval and Early Modern Mediterranean","We’ve all heard the one about the angry feminist killjoy. But what about the angry feminist killjoy who also cracks jokes? While a rich vein of enraged feminist humor currently proliferates in popular media, the use of comedy is divisive in feminism. In addition to being framed as potentially diluting righteous feminist anger, such levity could all too easily be dismissed as a surface-level “popular feminism” performance facilitating commodified individualism rather than sufficiently collectivist action. Yet in this essay I show that joking can be shot through with rage. I also argue that it can play a critical role in transmuting harrowing personal experiences into effective activism as well as building the resilience required for sustained activism. Situating debates about activist humor as part of broader intrafeminist dispute and division, I raise the possibility of a type of feminist anger not discussed in the contemporary discourse on women’s rage: namely, feminists’ anger at each other. While tensions between feminists and feminisms are often subterranean, tacit, and difficult to conclusively prove, denying, underplaying, or ignoring these frictions may risk a type of gaslighting—even though this is unintended. Relatedly, my case is that sharp feminist critiques of ideologies and hegemons might inadvertently cause offense to and alienate individual feminists who interpret such critiques as personal attacks. This highlights a broader tension between theory and praxis that, by my account, might be mitigated partly by furnishing a larger number of concrete suggestions about how collectivist action could manifest at the level of individual practice."
Making Markets on the Margins: Housing Finance Agencies and the Racial Politics of Credit Expansion,"AbstractThis article argues that two prominent antebellum Black physicians—James McCune Smith and Martin Delany—developed competing scientific theories of nature’s impact on the human body in response to the climatic theories of the American Colonization Society, polygenist race scientists, and southern defenders of slavery. It further argues that the physicians’ divergent conclusions regarding nature’s agency played a significant role in underwriting arguably the most important and consequential political debate in antebellum Black America—namely, the dispute between integrationists who advocated remaining in the United States and fighting for equality and emigrationists who argued that America was so hopelessly racist that African Americans should evacuate and even form their own nation. McCune Smith’s rejection of Liberian colonization, his call to stay in the United States and fight for inclusion, and his hopeful vision of the American future rested in large part on his climate science. Employing statistical evidence, he argued that all humans were healthiest in temperate rather than tropical climates and that a beneficial North American natural environment was slowly eliminating the racial distinctions that underwrote American racism and slavery and giving all Americans, regardless of ancestry, the physical features of Native Americans. Delany’s politics were also profoundly shaped by climate science, but, unlike McCune Smith, he agreed with polygenist race scientists that climate could not alter biological race. He further concluded that, while Black people remained healthy in all climates, white people degenerated physically, mentally, and morally when they migrated from a temperate to a subtropical or tropical climate. Since the North American natural environment could not eliminate the racial features referenced by white racists and slaveholders and because enfeebled whites would always need Black labor in the subtropical South, Delany took a pessimistic view of the American future and advocated that African Americans emigrate and form a new Black nation in a tropical location fatal to white people. The article demonstrates that, long before the rise of the environmental justice movement, prominent abolitionists wed the Black freedom struggle to sophisticated and even proto-ecological scientific models of the body’s place in nature. "

Rise Up in Mirth: On Angry Feminist Humor and Why Taking It Personally Is Political,"An important strand in contemporary political theory argues that democratic methods of political decision making should be extended to the global level. But are people’s fundamental views on public policy issues too diverse across the world for democracy? We examine systematically the empirical basis of two related concerns: that global democratic decision making would leave more people dissatisfied with the outcome of decisions than keeping democratic decision making within national settings and that it would increase the risk of persistent minorities, that is, groups who are systematically outvoted on most policy issues they care about. Using opinion polls covering 86% of the world population, we compare the distribution of policy values within countries to the distribution of policy values in the world as a whole. We find that the amount of dissatisfaction with policy and the risk of persistent minorities would not increase in a global democratic polity compared to individual states."
Antebellum Black Climate Science: The Medical Geography and Emancipatory Politics of James McCune Smith and Martin Delany,"Since the 1980s, neoliberal policies have been diffused around the world by international institutions established to support a very different world order. This article examines the repurposing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to become the world’s leading promoter of free markets. Social scientists commonly point to two modes of global-level institutional change: formal and fundamental transformations, like renegotiated treaties, or informal and incremental changes of a modest nature. The case of the IMF fits neither of these molds: it underwent a major transformation but without change in its formal foundations. Relying on archival material and interviews, the authors show that fundamental-yet-informal change was effected through a process of norm substitution—the alteration of everyday assumptions about the appropriateness of a set of activities. This transformation was led by the United States and rested on three pillars: mobilization of resources and allies, normalization of new practices, and symbolic work to stabilize the new modus operandi. This account denaturalizes neoliberal globalization and illuminates the clandestine politics behind its rise."
Longitude 45° East: New Evidence for one of the Oldest Political Frontiers in the Ancient World,"Identities and identity politics play a significant role in the lives of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Using empirical qualitative research with focus groups as the primary research method, this article is a critical investigation into the ways in which Syrian refugees in Lebanon are simultaneously politicized through their everyday lived experiences yet depoliticized through humanitarian policy and practice. In particular, the article explores how the politicization/depoliticization dichotomy impacts Syrian refugees’ access to and experiences within higher education opportunities made available for them in Lebanon. The article argues that humanitarianism’s inattentiveness to intersectional identities and social hierarchies of power has often resulted in physical and psychological educational exclusions and reinforced existing inequalities and fissures/divisions between different groups of refugees. In this way, higher education for refugees has often fallen short of its potential to transform lives."
"Dženan Dautović, Emir O. Filipović, and Neven Isailović, eds., Medieval Bosnia and South-East European Relations: Political, Religious, and Cultural Life at the Adriatic Crossroads","This article examines why Mexican peasants cultivate opium poppies, and argues that their cultural, political, and economic motivations for engaging in this illicit activity suggest an affinity with Alan Knight’s typology of the serrano peasant. Building on this comparison, I identify three strategies—“legalism,” “weapons of the weak,” and the threat or use of violence—that poppy farmers use to mitigate the dangers of participation in the drug trade, including attacks by state forces and various criminal organizations. The article concludes with a discussion of the ways poppy farmers have historically employed these strategies, and the factors that determine when and where they are used."
"The Nature of Hope: Grassroots Organizing, Environmental Justice, and Political Change. Edited by Char Miller and Jeff Crane. Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2018. viii + 353 pp. Notes and index. Paper $34.95.","When business owners and executives run for elected office, they claim their experience in business leaves them uniquely equipped to govern. Does electing a business owner or executive have an effect on public policy? With original data, including race, gender, political experience, and occupational backgrounds of 3,257 mayoral candidates from 263 cities, I document a striking lack of diversity in US mayoral politics and show that business owners and executives are extraordinarily well represented in American city halls. Nearly 32% of mayors have experience as a business owner or executive, making it the most common occupation across both time and geographic region. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that business executive mayors do shape municipal fiscal policy by shifting the allocation of expenditures, investing in infrastructure while curtailing redistributive spending. Notably, my results suggest that business executive is not simply a proxy for Republican partisanship."
Turn and Face the Strange Ch-Ch-Changes: How an Evolving America Activates Identity Politics,"This essay builds on insights into Malecasta’s wanton character to examine her politicized meaning in the allegory of The Faerie Queene Books I–III, as a discourteous and inhospitable threat to the idealized “British” and chaste woman warrior represented by Britomart. Malecasta represents in her bad rule of Castle Joyous (III.i) social pollution with a proto-racial emphasis, that is, degeneration. An unnoticed cognate with Malecasta’s punning name is the Spanish malecasta, to be of “mixed race.” As such, Malecasta in her “bower” appears to allegorize on one level the corrupting influence of Spanish and Continental romances, including those with Irish subject matter, and, on a political level, the Continental-leaning, colonial Old English culture found in Spenser’s Ireland: old noble houses that had intermingled with the Irish, grown and decayed over centuries through excess wealth and power. Comparisons are made with Acrasia in the Bower of Bliss to demonstrate how Britomart in Castle Joyous must not only resist her own sexualized nature but must avoid being pulled down to the muddy level of Malecasta’s corrupted social sphere."
"Chris Fitter, Majesty and the Masses in Shakespeare and Marlowe: Western Anti-monarchism, the Earl of Essex Challenge, and Political Stagecraft","This essay traces the ways that activists and ordinary citizens mobilize coraje in order to navigate the constraints of colonial capitalism in contemporary Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coraje has a dual meaning referring to courage as well as anger or rage. Drawing from feminist theories of rage, I argue that coraje is an essential political emotion necessary for structural transformation. In addition to situating coraje within a decolonial feminist framework, I examine a series of examples that demonstrate how coraje has emerged as a key target of state repression. I argue that the state is preoccupied with the growing coraje being articulated by Puerto Ricans because coraje has the potential to create networks of solidarity grounded in a refusal of the current order. Both the local and federal government have increasingly criminalized articulations of political coraje and have utilized the Puerto Rico Police Department to repress displays of coraje in the streets. In addition to violence wielded at the hands of the police, the colonial government and its functionaries, as well as members of the public, have criticized protesters for failing to adhere to colonial and gendered norms of propriety and respectability, thereby justifying the repression aimed at those taking to the streets. Ultimately, I argue that in their collective coraje, Puerto Ricans who had felt silenced by colonial capitalism, misogyny, queer antagonism, and racism have found a way to push back and articulate a different way of living in Puerto Rico."
"Reform, Revolution, and the “Original Catastrophe”: Political Change in Prussia and Germany on the Eve of the First World War","This essay focuses on the role of the newspapers in extending the reach and impact of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History’s (ASNLH) Exhibition of Works by Negro Artists (1933), which the Smithsonian National Gallery of Art hosted. I analyze how the press advanced the show’s politics of representation through accounts produced by critics writing in the black and white newspapers. By covering certain aspects of the exhibition, reporters highlighted black Americans’ achievements in the visual arts. This emphasis on the aesthetic abilities of the African American artists in the show aligned with the goals of progressive politicians and civil rights activists at the time, including Carter G. Woodson, the founder and head of the ASNLH."
How Political Identity Influences Covid-19 Risk Perceptions: A Model of Identity-Based Risk Perceptions,"This article examines the integral role of affect in feminist and decolonial social movements. Looking at the strategic interplay between two affective modes—rage and joy—in the Young Lords’ activism and organizing from 1969 to 1972, it argues that the organization was exceptional in understanding how affect animates and is animated by social movements. Specifically, the article focuses on the Women’s Caucus (later Women’s Union) of the Young Lords, which scholars have praised as one of the most successful examples of feminist organizing within the decolonial and nationalist movements of the 1960s and ’70s. The Women’s Caucus provides an early model of feminist organizing that emphasizes the important role that affects play in creating activist community. Their attention to affect allowed them to construct strategic ways of combining rage and joy that, along with making their activism sustainable, also paved the way for nonhegemonic performances of gender. The article argues that the feminist restructuring of the Young Lords in 1970, led by the Women’s Caucus, ushered in a more egalitarian organizational structure, in part through the way it centered the role of affects related to rage and joy in political organizing. As a result of this, the Women’s Caucus provided a model for decolonial feminist praxis that creates alternate forms of kinship, prioritizes care of self and community, and claims public space for nontraditional performances of femininity and masculinity."
The Political Stakes of Literary Theory in Eastern Europe during the Cold War: Introduction,"Research shows that elite polarization and mass sorting have led to an explosion of hostility between parties, but how do Republicans and Democrats feel toward their own respective parties? Have these trends led to more cohesion or more division within parties? Using the American National Election Studies time series, we first show that intraparty polarization between ideologically extreme and ideologically moderate partisans is on the rise. Second, we demonstrate that this division within parties has important implications for how we think about affective polarization between parties. Specifically, the distribution of relative affect between parties has not become bimodal but merely dispersed. Thus, while the mean partisan has become affectively polarized, the modal partisan has not. These results suggest polarization and sorting may be increasing the viability of third-party candidates and making realignment more likely."
Could Global Democracy Satisfy Diverse Policy Values? An Empirical Analysis,"This ethnographic essay studies the politics of gender that emerged around a women’s self-defense initiative developed by an extremist right-wing party in Mumbai. This campaign involved the public distribution of modified kitchen knives as arms for poor women cadres. Implementing the program in the context of the controversial “India rape crisis,” the party stated that underprivileged women workers, who battled the threat of rape and sexual harassment while negotiating public spaces, must intimidate and stab predators with these knives, which were especially designed for poor women’s moral and physical protection. My interdisciplinary analysis investigates the ways in which this nationalist knife crusade temporarily reconstructed gendered texts on women’s use and access of public space, by placing itself strategically at the intersection of urban and gendered paranoid performances (which I develop here as “urbanoid enactments”). Through an analysis of mythohistorical, material, and moral cultures that are intimately associated with a global urban paranoia about women’s sexual vulnerability to unwanted male migrant bodies in the public sphere, I argue that such nationalist gimmicks inform a contemporary political debate about strategic right-wing endorsements and their proximate relationships with women’s imagination of migration, mobility, and bodily freedoms in the commercial city."
The Making of Neoliberal Globalization: Norm Substitution and the Politics of Clandestine Institutional Change,"This article explores the relation between linguistic and nonlinguistic signs in enregisterment processes (Agha 2007) through the analysis of multimodal images of racial otherness in YouTube videos. It aims to show the role of images in indexing social meaning and performing hegemonic Whiteness among metropolitan Cameroonian-French elites living in Paris, through the use of a specific semiotic register indexing an “Afropolitan” persona – an elite, socially mobile and transnational type of Blackness. By focusing on the poiesis of “image-texts” (Nakassis 2019), this article will contribute to understanding the “total semiotic fact” of racial and social differentiation. It will also demonstrate that these images constitute a counter-discourse and are political acts that negotiate agency and contest power relations."
Identity Politics and Syrian Refugees in Lebanon: Implications for Higher Education,"AbstractThis article describes a period when environmental organizations actively worked to achieve equal rights for women in the 1970s and 1980s. Using archival records from the Environmental Defense Fund and from women’s occupational health activists, I argue that a significant, if under-recognized, catalyst for environmentalists’ engagement with feminist politics was the emergence of workplace exclusion policies. Pushed to hire women by newly enforced sex discrimination statutes in the 1970s, industrial employers categorically excluded women from jobs with hazardous toxic substances. Environmentalists joined a coalition of labor and women’s rights advocates that together challenged exclusion policies in the courts and regulatory agencies. The coalition devised a litigation strategy that they hoped would raise environmental standards and end sex discrimination, issues that they saw as intrinsically related. They forwarded an equal protection approach to environmental hazards as part of a broader campaign to expand how regulators assessed toxic risks. They sought gender-neutral protection, and they challenged the gender biases in scientific research priorities and regulatory standards. Their litigation culminated in the US Supreme Court’s decision in United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls (1991), which prohibited sex-based exclusion policies. In the realms of women’s employment law and abortion rights, the case was a success. It was not, however, a milestone for environmental protection. It failed to achieve key coalition objectives since it did not raise environmental standards or require companies to remediate toxic workplaces. Ultimately, the ruling preserved equal risks in toxic jobs rather than asserting equal rights to environmental protection."
"Richard S. Wortman, The Power of Language and Rhetoric in Russian Political History: Charismatic Words from the 18th to the 21st Centuries","In recent years, the Central Asian countries (CACs) have received increasing attention from international research and political communities. After gaining independence in 1991, the CACs went through diverse processes of political and economic transformations. However, the political and economic evolutions of these countries diverged substantially from what the Western community expected, especially in terms of regional economic cooperation. This article contends that the Central Asian countries have never been part of the currently decomposing system of liberal hegemony. Instead, they have followed divergent paths of transition, which have hindered regional and international cooperation. Additionally, during recent years, the region has become a complex arena in which national goals coexist with the interests of the major regional powers, Russia and China. Therefore, the evolution of the Central Asian countries over the last decades provides an example of the varied and complex nature of regionalism in a post-liberal world. This article uses an international political economy approach to address the complex interaction between the economic and political fields, both locally and internationally."
"Michelle Chaplin Sanchez, Calvin and the Resignification of the World: Creation, Incarnation, and the Problem of Political Theology in the 1559 Institutes","This essay argues that Jonson’s late Elizabethan comedy Poetaster explores in highly complex ways the role of defamatory accusations in the operation of state power, the defense of public morality, and the status of poetry as a form of moral discourse. It does this through two plot-lines, one consisting of efforts by the informer Asinius Lupus to ingratiate himself with the Emperor Augustus by accusing the poets Ovid and Vergil of sedition; the other involving conflicts between Horace, who represents Jonson himself, and other characters who complain against his satires as seditious libels. Lupus’ successful accusation against Ovid raises difficult issues about whether a ruler committed to restoring public morality can tolerate erotic poetry and playfully scandalous erotic behavior within his own family and household. Close reading suggests that Jonson regarded eroticism as less dangerous than the jealous repression of libidinous instincts, but he provides enough outwardly plausible support for the case against Ovid to challenge thought. In the play Horace successfully defends himself by claiming that his satire attacks vices rather than individuals and that his accusers have defamed him by claiming otherwise. But this position is coyly undermined by the fact that two of those accusers are thinly veiled caricatures of Jonson’s rival poets Thomas Dekker and John Marston, who are subjected to ritual humiliation at the play’s conclusion. By engaging in defamation even while pretending to repudiate it, Jonson implied that despite their potential for misuse, libelous attacks on individuals remained a necessary weapon of the satiric poet.

"Serrano Communities and Subaltern Negotiation Strategies: The Local Politics of Opium Production in Mexico, 1940–2020","How do politicians locate industrial projects, such as special economic zones and industrial townships, that have highly localized costs (population displacement) and benefits (jobs and infrastructure)? I argue that risk-averse politicians minimize the costs of displacement for industrial projects by locating the projects in areas where they have little existing support. In order to maximize the benefits of the projects, politicians also locate the projects far from state or national borders to ensure that the future benefits of the projects accrue only to potential voters. To test this argument, I geocode the locations of public and private special economic zones in India and use private zones as a control group for public zones. The analysis finds support for the argument in that public zones are significantly more likely to be located in constituencies where the government performed badly in prior elections and far from state and national borders."
Engaged Anthropology: Politics beyond the Text by Stuart Kirsch,"We explore a quasi-natural experiment to assess whether a prosecutor’s political concerns affect rape’s prosecution. In 2006 rape charges were filed against players on Duke University’s lacrosse team. Although innocent, the student-athletes’ prosecution took place during the prosecutor’s primary and general election contests. We argue that this case made salient to voters across the state the concern regarding wrongful prosecution. Following a difference-in-difference strategy, we explore whether rape’s prosecution varies by the prosecutor’s reelection pressures and whether behavior adjusted after the media covered the scandal. We find significant changes in both the case filing levels and the use of jury trials. Fewer rape charges were filed after the Duke lacrosse case and the difference between the case filings during reelection years and nonelection years is muted. There are both fewer cases taken to trial after the scandal and an escalation in this effect during a prosecutor’s reelection. The results strongly suggest that the two important margins, whether to even pursue a conviction and whether to pursue it at trial, are affected by a prosecutor’s retention concerns."
"Politics in China: An Introduction, edited by William A. Joseph","Former government officials have many different opportunities to cash in on their public service, but most academic research and government ethics regulations focus on lobbying. We argue that this focus understates the extent and diversity of employment opportunities available to former officials. Using a new data set of officeholders in American government (members of Congress, governors, members of the cabinet, executive branch officials, and ambassadors), we show that, with the exception of members of the House, former officials are more likely to join boards of public companies than they are to work as registered lobbyists. Furthermore, former officials join boards more quickly and face fewer ethics regulations compared to lobbyists. Increasing restrictions on lobbying also appears to push former officials toward alternative employment such as board service. Our findings demonstrate the breadth of the labor market for former politicians and suggest fruitful new avenues for research on political careers."
Business Owners and Executives as Politicians: The Effect on Public Policy,"In the absence of extensive written sources, the history of the Macedonian kingdom prior           to the reign of Philip II remains largely understudied. Yet, the archaeological record of           the region, although primarily of funerary character, has much to contribute in this           direction. In this article, I examine the funerary evidence particularly from the           Classical period until the rise of Philip II. Focusing especially on vases, which formed           the most common type of offering, my discussion begins with an overview of the types that           appear in classical Macedonian graves until ca. 360 B.C.E. Then, with the aim of defining           the possible ideological and practical funerary functions of these artifacts, my analysis           moves to the patterns of intra- and intersite synchronic variability in their consumption.           Changing to a diachronic perspective, I demonstrate that between the sixth and the fourth           centuries B.C.E. the patterns of synchronic variation in the funerary consumption of vases           did not remain constant. Finally, I argue that changes in these patterns are strongly           suggestive of specific transformations in the sociopolitical structures of the kingdom.           However, I stress that this interpretation needs to be tested against evidence from           nonritual contexts, which at this time remains scanty."
"Politics of Renewable Energy in China, by Chen Gang","Most democracies allow their members of parliament to concurrently be employed in the private sector. A widespread worry is that politicians leverage their current or past posts within parliament, for example, as ministers or committee chairs, to gain lucrative jobs. However, we know little about whether “moonlighting” income is indeed driven by these positions. I analyze comprehensive new panel data on the private sector earnings of all members of the UK House of Commons during 2010–16. Focusing on within-legislator variation, I find that currently holding an influential position does not cause an increase in income from outside jobs. Politicians do see higher earnings soon after leaving their parliamentary posts, but this effect is concentrated among cabinet ministers. The article advances the literature by identifying which political posts lead to financial benefits in the private sector—and when."
The Politics of Scale: A History of Rangeland Science by Nathan F. Sayre,"Public bathing was integral to daily life in ancient Rome. Today, imperial baths loom large in reconstructions of the ancient city, where they evoke the splendor of this uniquely public and social urban tradition. Although archaeological and literary evidence reveals that baths flourished in Rome as early as the third century B.C.E., comparatively little is known about those small, dark, for-profit establishments. This paper examines the introduction of baths into Rome and the earliest bathing facilities before turning to the urban and political impact of the Thermae Agrippae (Baths of Agrippa), constructed in the late first century B.C.E. The formerly private bath complex, made public upon Agrippa's death, marks a radical departure from previous establishments, offering expansive gardens filled with sculpture, large pools, and impressive architecture. This paper, for the first time, traces similarities in the innovative design and luxurious decoration of the Thermae Agrippae with that of the private urban estates (horti) of elites in Rome. It situates Agrippa's bequest in an era in which the expediency of offering public access to elite private spaces was rapidly becoming evident to Rome's most astute politicians. This nationalization of Agrippa's former estate aligns with Augustan urban policies and explains a significant shift in architectural nomenclature: from balnea to thermae."
"Building the Thermae Agrippae: Private Life, Public Space, and the Politics of Bathing in Early Imperial Rome","Right-wing policy approaches addressing violence against women often draw from xenophobic conceptions of racialized groups as culturally backward. While antiracist, anticolonial feminist scholarship has convincingly critiqued this, how to talk about culture in a context of gendered racism remains pressingly unresolved. In our work, we examine how the politics of culture shape policies and practices designed to combat violence against women in the Canadian immigration context. Using interviews with fifteen service providers conducted in 2011–12 during a time of heightened attention to violence against women among South Asian immigrants, we show how advocates challenged stigmatizing conceptions of violence as cultural, rejecting what we call “culture talk” in favor of more structural explanations. However, advocates also struggled to account for what we would call the “cultural specificities” of the violence they witnessed, often substituting the term “community” for “culture” to avoid racialization. We then analyze parliamentary debates surrounding the 2015 right-wing Conservative government passage of the Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act, which targeted forced marriage, polygamy, and honor-based violence. Right-wing politicians incorporated both “culture” and “community” to deflect accusations of racism while nevertheless engaging in racializing discourse, illustrating the limits of the turn to “community.” Acknowledging the dangers of culture talk, our analysis builds on feminist scholarship to call for renewed approaches to talking about culture—not as a totalizing force but as situated practices of meaning making that inform all acts of violence and responses to violence."
"Franklin I. Gamwell, Existence and the Good: Metaphysical Necessity in Morals and Politics","Historical trends seem to show that populism, defined here as movements that self-identify as representatives of a unified good people confronting a corrupted or malevolent elite, tends to co-occur with major economic disruptions. However, research into this connection provides us with a puzzle: while populist surges often come in the wake of economic crises, cultural variables tend to be better predictors of support for populism in public opinion surveys. In this article, we develop a theory (affective political economy) that can resolve this paradox by analyzing the influence of emotions on politics. Using survey experiments, we show that economic crises cause emotional reactions that activate cultural discontent. This, in turn, activates populist attitudes. This article provides an elegant solution to a major impasse in the study of the demand side of populism and provides a useful way of analyzing how economics and culture may interact to cause political outcomes."
Achieving Access: Professional Movements and the Politics of Health Universalism by Joseph Harris,"Until its defeat in 2009, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) controlled numerous civil institutions in the north and east of Sri Lanka. However, the Hindu temples within these territories managed to maintain their autonomy. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Sri Lanka, I contend that central to this paradox was contestation over who had the power to govern the life and death of Tamil subjects. Revisiting the anthropology of sovereignty, I propose an alternative idiom of sovereignty: a vulnerable sovereignty emerging with Hindu deities and based on interdependency and coexistence. I stress that vulnerability does not necessarily make the deities powerless but is the point where the sovereign deity reasserts its power. Finally, I contend that, faced with this idiom of sovereignty, the LTTE learned to embody its logic in its relation with the deities. I argue, thus, that sovereigns can also be thought of outside the notion of absolute sovereign power, bare life, and biopower and instead as sites of vulnerability."
"Kellie Carter Jackson, Force and Freedom: Black Abolitionists and the Politics of Violence","The anarchic international system is actually heavily structured: communities of states join together for common benefit; strong states form hierarchical relationships with weak states to enforce order and achieve preferred outcomes. Breaking from prior research, we conceptualize structures such as community and hierarchy as properties of networks of states’ interactions that can capture unobserved constraints in state behavior, constraints that may reduce conflict. We offer two claims. One, common membership in trade communities pacifies to the extent that breaking trade ties would entail high switching costs: thus, we expect heavy arms trade, more than most types of commercial trade, to reduce intracommunity conflict. Two, this is driven by hierarchical communities in which strong states can use high switching costs as leverage to constrain conflict between weaker states in the community. We find empirical support for these claims using a time-dependent multilayer network model and a new measure of hierarchy based on network centrality."
"Alex Csiszar, The Scientific Journal: Authorship and the Politics of Knowledge in the Nineteenth Century","In The Prince, Machiavelli often associates power with force and the ability to compel obedience. In the Discourses on Livy and Florentine Histories, however, he emphasizes the role that moral authority has played in the construction of princely power, especially in republics like ancient Rome and modern Florence. This article explores the alternative style of princely virtù that Machiavelli associates with these princes and contrasts it with cruder forms of fraud, like moral hypocrisy, playing the hero, and ideological innovation. Finally, it shows how Machiavelli’s analysis of power and princely virtù constitutes a revival of the historiographic tradition epitomized by Thucydides, Sallust, and Tacitus, in which irony is used to critique the social grammars that princes have used to underwrite their domination."
"Machiavelli’s Virtuous Princes: Rhetoric, Power, and the Politics of Ironic Historiography","During the early twentieth century, several artists from Pueblo communities in New Mexico and Hopi in Arizona took up watercolor painting, using the new (to them) medium to produce largely representational scenes of community activities. Cochiti Pueblo artist Tonita Peña was the only woman in this group, necessitating her navigation of gender as well as racial stereotypes. Peña was expected to produce the abstracted imagery seen on Pueblo pottery, a visual style and an art form long coded as women’s work. Using a series of images in which Peña depicts women making Pueblo pottery as an interpretive linchpin, this article argues that these scenes foreground the care Peña took to avoid inappropriate revelations of Pueblo sacred knowledge. Moreover, they evince an epistemological celebration of a practice considered women’s work even as she pictorialized it in a medium and style deemed inappropriate for her gender."

Most of the scholarly and media coverage of the practice, and the growing movement against it, depict fracking in terms of a contentious debate between pro- and antifracking advocates in which both sides claim that their position is supported by scientific evidence regarding whether fracking causes negative health outcomes, environmental degradation, seismic activity, and water contamination. Less attention, however, has been given to the feminist and gender implications of that debate. This critical discourse analysis examines the role that gender has played in the debates surrounding fracking by analyzing qualitative interviews, industry-sponsored articles, and news reports. Examining a series of moments in which gender has appeared in the public discourse about fracking, it argues that the fracking debate is framed through a gender perspective in ways that have produced knowledge about the nature of science, objectivity, and gender itself."
The Death of Idealism: Development and Anti-Politics in the Peace Corps by Meghan Elizabeth Kallman,"This article uses reputation theory to address a century-old puzzle: what guides the choice of coordination efforts in large politico-administrative systems? Max Weber, founder of the modern study of bureaucracy, famously considered a hierarchy superior to other organizational models. However, modern governments are not organized as one big hierarchy but as a set of parallel hierarchies, typically 15–20 ministries. This raises a coordination challenge, which in practice has proven surprisingly difficult to meet. Based on reputation theory, we argue that concerns of audience management are likely to be an important factor when deciding on the level of coordination. We investigate this argument in the European Union’s central executive institution, the EU Commission. Based on more than 7,000 cases from the EU Commission’s internal digital coordination system we analyze the impact of audience sensitivity and audience involvement on coordination efforts. Our findings suggest that audience concerns are important drivers of agencies’ interdepartmental coordination."
Tonita Peña and the Politics of Pueblo Art,"Seminal models of clientelism assert that parties value brokers for their strong downward ties to voters. Despite its dominance, scholars have not empirically scrutinized key assumptions of this theory due to the challenges of measuring brokers’ network connections. We analyze unique data from three sources—Ghana’s voter register, a handmade catalog of local elites, and a large-scale survey of aspiring party brokers. We show that the observable implications of the standard model do not hold: brokers know surprisingly few voters, brokers with more downward connections are not the most active or effective, and parties do not select the brokers who know the most voters. Instead, brokers with the most upward connections to local elites appear to be the most valuable to parties. We build inductively from these results to develop an alternative theory of brokers, proposing that many parties value “problem solvers” over “monitors.”"
Exit and Voice: The Paradox of Cross-Border Politics in Mexico by Lauren Duquette-Rury,"Do politicians benefit electorally from connections to banks? Recent research illuminates how banks benefit from political connections, yet we do not know much about the impact of bank connections on a politician’s reelection chances. We consider the German system of publicly owned local savings banks to assess whether local politicians who sit on bank boards are likelier to win reelection for their parties. Based on data from 3,214 mayoral elections and 182 savings banks between 2006 and 2015, we find that mayors with a board seat in a savings bank have higher odds of winning reelection than mayors without a board seat. We address concerns about unobserved confounders and show that the electoral benefits of board membership are concentrated among conservative mayors. We also present preliminary evidence that mayors in bank boards increase bank donations to, and prevent branch closures in, their municipalities, which helps us understand why voters reelect them."
"Talbot Imlay, The Practice of Socialist Internationalism: European Socialists and International Politics, 1914–1960","Political science has long debated the significance of protest during a democratic transition, but attention has been largely confined to its impact on elite support for democracy. Contributing to scholarship on the attitudinal consequences of mobilization, we examine how protest shaped popular perceptions of democracy during the post-Mubarak transition in Egypt. We do this by matching wave 2 of the Arab Barometer survey with georeferenced protest events reported in Arabic-language newspapers. Our results show that Egyptians came to hold less favorable attitudes to democracy following sustained protest in their district. We find that this relationship was principally driven by longer-lasting, static street protests that targeted public space. Qualitative case details illustrate how such tactics could disrupt everyday life and affect livelihoods. These findings highlight one way in which popular support for democracy can be eroded during a transition."
Landscapes of Power and the Language of Authority (Powell's Landscapes of Power: Politics of Energy in the Navajo Nation),"Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and managerial expertise, businesspeople in office adopt policies favorable to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term accumulation of human capital. Businesspeople also do not reduce budget deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all, businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business, rather than like a business."
"David E. Campbell, John C. Green, and J. Quin Monson, Seeking the Promised Land: Mormons and American Politics","Disability is a concept that grows as we think about it, forcing us to adjust our conversations in vocabulary and rhetoric depending on which disability world we inhabit or address. Understanding disability starts with exposure to disabled people’s bodyminds in their own spacetime and an appreciation of disability expertise. The disability justice movement pulls the intersectional performance of disability out of the intimate sphere so that it can play a role in policy, an analytic where anthropology should shine. This article is particularly addressed to anthropologists with a new interest in disability and critical disability studies scholars with a frustration with anthropology. I use exemplary analysis of actual dialogues drawn from an autoethnographic record of my own perceived mobility and speech impairments to explore my biopolitical positioning as disabled. Anthropologists have the capacity to move disability theory forward, feeding it with ethnographic fuel. While the anthropology of disability uses insightful ethnographic methods to understand specific impairments in specific contexts, the reflexive turn in anthropology has not yet embraced disability. We are still better off remaining individual disability experts; our collective efforts are still an “embarrassment to power.” This article, as part of a collective special issue, aims to change that."
"Molly Loberg, The Struggle for the Streets of Berlin: Politics, Consumption, and Urban Space, 1914–1945","This article investigates the influence of lobbying, electoral incentives, and US state governors’ party affiliation on environmental expenditures. A theoretical framework is presented, emphasizing the potential impact of lobbying from interest groups on environmental policies. The major causal link for environmental expenditures depends on the governor’s political preferences. Implementing a regression discontinuity design (RDD), we identify and estimate the causal effect of state governors on the level of environmental expenditures. We test whether governors tend to deviate from their own political preferences when facing pressures from polluting lobbies and electoral incentives from environmental organizations. The empirical results reveal that, when Democratic governors are in charge, environmental expenditures are, on average, higher. However, in oil-abundant states, and/or in states where polluting industries are economically important, Democratic politicians tend to allocate fewer resources to environmental preservation, suggesting that political pressure from lobbying groups matters."
"Amir Teicher, Social Mendelism: Genetics and the Politics of Race in Germany, 1900–1948","This article uses three Ho-Chunk discussions of “whiteness” (from first contact to the mid-twentieth century) to outline an approach to Indigenous knowledge that challenges approaches that depict other cultures as constituting incommensurable worlds. Arguing that the idea of ontological alterity leads to a form of ethnographic entrapment, it instead theorizes Indigenous knowledge production as a process rooted in empirical observation, moral evaluation, and critical engagement within a common but contested world. The Ho-Chunk examples illustrate a long-term, collective process of inquiry that produced an understanding of settler whiteness emphasizing its relationship to practices of dispossession and governance. They also show events in which such knowledge was used by Ho-Chunk people in efforts to compel white interlocutors to self-awareness and more reasonable forms of behavior."
"Jonathan Fenderson, Building the Black Arts Movement: Hoyt Fuller and the Cultural Politics of the 1960s","Reactions against progressive politics are sweeping across liberal democracies, and populism is rising globally. To successfully counter these political shifts, which we conceptualize as backlash, feminists will need more specific understandings of what backlash entails. In the introduction to this symposium, we pose four sets of questions about backlash. First, what is backlash, and how is backlash distinguished from discrimination? Second, which persons and which locations matter when we consider backlash, and how do different points of departure shape our understanding of the phenomenon? Third, how does backlash work? Fourth, how can feminists counter backlash? To answer these questions, we synthesize the arguments from our contributors and from the academic and policy-oriented literature, mapping alternate approaches to backlash and offering different visions of feminists’ challenges and future agendas."
"Shifting Boundaries: Immigrant Youth Negotiating National, State, and Small-Town Politics by Alexis Silver","Lawyers in the ongoing opioid litigation have obtained millions of documents from the drug manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies blamed for the ravages of the opioid crisis. What will happen to these documents if the suits are settled? Will they form a public archive of one of the worst man-made public health disasters in memory? Or will they remain locked away, perhaps permanently? In search for answers, this piece traces a longer history of the role of the courts in shaping the public record on drugs. It discusses what the recent scholarship on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical knowledge owes to past litigation against the drug industry, but also highlights some of the forces that have eroded the public record in both the scientific and legal arenas over the last few decades. These forces, I argue, have converged in the case of opioids, raising urgent questions about the implications of litigating public health issues in secret."
"Unnatural Resources: Energy and Environmental Politics in Appalachia after the 1973 Oil Embargo. By Michael Camp. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2019. x + 192 pp. Notes and index. Cloth $40.00, e-book $35.00.","Taking canonical literary texts as sources for drawing or poetry-writing, the New York Sketch Club’s meetings seemed to epitomize the notion that its members—writers and artists including William Cullen Bryant, Thomas Cole, and Asher Durand—were “kindred spirits” engaged in a shared project of consolidating national identity through aesthetic practice. This essay, by contrast, describes the club’s obsession with optically and textual uncertainty—including illegible handwriting, sketches based on radically reimagined literary sources, and weakly visualizable artworks—as shaping a literally less-visible register of involvement with the violence of tribal dispossession and African slavery. Racialized forms of power appear in this account as forces underwriting the canon of “American” art that developed through the pictorial and narrative activities of the Sketch Club."
"Race, Violence, and the Textual Politics of the New York Sketch Club","In 2015, the Modern Art Museum (MAM) in Mexico City put on a much-anticipated exhibit of the works of Lorena Wolffer, a feminist artist and political activist known for tackling issues of gender-based violence in her work. However, the exhibit soon became a flash point for a debate about sexual violence in art institutions and the personal responsibilities of artist activists when a MAM worker was harassed and fired. Many members of the Mexican artistic community loudly condemned Wolffer for denouncing sexual violence in her work while not doing enough to help the victim and even going ahead with her show. This article analyzes Wolffer’s oeuvre—situating it within both Mexico’s contemporary political climate and existing debates on feminist activist art—and the scandal at the museum. It argues that the personal and professional expectations and critiques placed on many feminist artists arise not simply from the subject matter of their work but also from the form that their artistic practice takes and the types of labor it entails, which often include decentering the authorial element of creation, giving voice and presence to ordinary citizens, helping victims of gender- and sexual-based violence heal, and educating the broader public about these issues. This often entails privileging the artistic process over the production of objects that are sold in the art market. To bear out this argument, this article contrasts Wolffer’s work with that of Santiago Sierra, an artist who engages in politically critical art but eschews normative political commitments and activism. The article concludes that while the artistic field in Mexico is ostensibly becoming more open to feminist art and nontraditional artistic practices, its organizational, curatorial, and critical facets remain staunchly antithetical to a feminist project."
"Peter C. Caldwell and Karrin Hanshew, Germany since 1945: Politics, Culture, and Society; Frank Bösch, A History Shared and Divided: East and West Germany since the 1970s","Previous research on welfare state development in federal states has claimed that interstate competition induces a race to the bottom with regard to social expenditure. While existing research has focused on the impact of migration inflows of poor households on states with high provision of social expenditure, it has remained silent with regard to migration outflows. In this article, I argue that migration outflows are associated with increased social expenditure if eligibility restrictions for social benefits between states are relaxed. Facing outflows of workers and the unemployed, low-spending states respond with increases in social expenditure to retain a sufficient workforce and counteract rising wage levels. As a result, states with higher levels of outward migration are catching up with more generous states instead of engaging in a race to the bottom. To support my claim, I use a time-series cross-sectional data set of Swiss cantons covering the period 1930–75."
"Christopher Clark, Time and Power: Visions of History in German Politics, from the Thirty Years’ War to the Third Reich","In the early 1970s, a group of activists sought to transform rock culture from the inside out. Their name? The Chicago Women’s Liberation Rock Band (CWLRB). Founded by Naomi Weisstein as a work group of the socialist-feminist Chicago Women’s Liberation Union, the CWLRB was a feminist collective that performed nationwide from 1970 to 1973. By writing songs about women’s experiences; recording an album with their sister group, the New Haven Women’s Liberation Rock Band; and adopting sonic techniques and performance styles that they felt would not alienate their audiences, the CWLRB pushed back against the misogyny of 1970s rock culture and positioned rock music as a tool for feminist activism. Despite their unique experiment in rock-and-roll feminism, the band remains largely absent from public memory. This study recovers the CWLRB’s story to complicate scholarly and popular understandings of “women’s music” and cultural feminism in the 1970s by revealing a feminist band that was not separatist and that aimed to reach a wide audience. Furthermore, this study considers how the CWLRB’s lyrics, sound, performance, and paratexts, while rooted in the concerns and aesthetics of the American women’s liberation movement, are also connected to the riot grrrl punk rock feminism of the 1990s. The CWLRB challenges the categorical constructions of second- and third-wave feminism by highlighting how multiple generations have resisted the sexism of rock culture, allowing scholars to move toward an understanding of rock-and-roll feminism as a historical form of public feminist practice."
"James M. Vaughn, The Politics of Empire at the Accession of George III: The East India Company and the Crisis and Transformation of Britain’s Imperial State","Following its nominal independence from Britain in 1922, Egypt increasingly protested continued European control of the Service des antiquités de l'Égypte, the office that administered archaeology and the antiquities trade. Public conflicts were frequent, pitting Western researchers against Egyptian nationalists who advocated for the decolonization of the Service. Research in the University of Michigan's archives reveals the impact of these conflicts on the university's papyrus collection, specifically the papyri and ostraka excavated in the Fayyum between 1924 and 1935. Unlike other objects, excavated texts were not subjected to immediate partage but were instead loaned to Michigan on the understanding that they would be divided after publication. In response to Egyptian pressure in the 1930s, however, the Service began to assert its right to recall the loans and frequently urged Michigan to expedite their publication and return. By the early 1950s, the largely Egyptianized postwar Service finally issued a recall, thereby abrogating the promised partage. Some 1,900 excavated texts nonetheless still remain in Ann Arbor, Michigan, their ownership status uncertain. In view of the recent series of controversies involving papyri of uncertain ownership and provenance, this research is of considerable salience and represents a move toward full transparency at papyrus-holding institutions.1"
"Down’s Syndrome Screening and Reproductive Politics: Care, Choice, and Disability in the Prenatal Clinic by Gareth M. Thomas","Asset declarations requiring politicians to disclose their financial information are becoming increasingly common across the world. The information contained in these disclosures frequently reveals that politicians rapidly accumulate wealth while in office, a fact that may raise suspicion among voters. However, little is known about the ways in which such information may affect voter behavior. To address this gap, we use original experimental and survey data from India to explore voters’ reactions to information about wealth and wealth accumulation. Results suggest that voters strongly disapprove of wealth accumulation in office and associate it with corruption and political violence. Further analyses suggest several mechanisms that may partly explain why many “wealth accumulators” win elections in India despite these negative reactions. Voters generally lack information about disclosures and many weigh wealth accumulation less than some other prominent concerns, such as performance in office or caste-based appeals."
"The Pursuit of Happiness: Black Women, Diasporic Dreams, and the Politics of Emotional Transnationalism by Bianca C. Williams","Democratic elections are supposed to prevent corrupt politicians from winning office. In practice, however, corrupt politicians frequently get elected for public office in mass elections. In this article, we examine how voters respond to corruption allegations against political candidates and how voter responses may be attenuated by patronage and partisanship. We test these explanations through a survey experiment in South Africa—a country where political corruption is a recurrent issue. We find that voters express strong willingness to punish corrupt candidates. However, voters are more lenient toward corrupt politicians when they are offered work or jobs in return for their vote as part of a clientelist exchange. This effect is amplified for people living in economic hardship. These findings suggest that some types of clientelism serve to reproduce corruption—particularly when poverty is rife—and have important implications for the fight against corruption."
"China and the Islamic World: How the New Silk Road Is Transforming Global Politics, by Robert R. Bianchi","The nascent literature on the political consequences of technological change studies either left-behind voters or successful technology entrepreneurs (“superstars”). However, it neglects the large share of skilled workers who benefit from limited but steady economic improvements in the knowledge economy. This article examines how workplace digitalization affects political preferences among the entire active labor force by combining individual-level panel data from the United Kingdom with industry-level data on information and communication technology capital stocks between 1997 and 2017. We first demonstrate that digitalization was economically beneficial for workers with middle and high levels of education. We then show that growth in digitalization increased support for the Conservative Party, increased support for the incumbent party, and voter turnout among beneficiaries of economic change. Our results hold in an instrumental variable analysis and multiple robustness checks. While digitalization undoubtedly produces losers (along with some superstars), ordinary winners of digitalization are an important stabilizing force that is content with the political status quo."
"Tracy Chapman Hamilton, Pleasure and Politics at the Court of France: The Artistic Patronage of Queen Marie of Brabant (1260–1321)","This article examines the ways in which water was used both practically and rhetorically by rural women, urban laundresses, and commercial laundrymen in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While their experiences differed in important ways, all launders grappled with hard water, which decomposed soap and left unsightly residue on clean clothes. Water’s mineral makeup seriously affected the work of getting clothes clean and necessitated water-softening techniques and technologies. Whether they worked in a free-standing home, a tenement, or commercial establishment, launderers constantly wrestled with the materiality of water, which in turn fostered an environmental knowledge of water’s nuances. An examination of the language they employed to describe that knowledge, however, reveals the ways that people imparted cultural beliefs and values on nonhuman nature. Launderers used water in discourses of race and gender to empower themselves and disempower their competitors. A focus on water in the laundry, and on the language that surrounded it, underscores the ways in which people have long understood both labor and nature in gendered and racial terms."
Expuestas: Laborious Expectations and the Plight of Feminist Art in Contemporary Mexico,"This is an analysis of the way that the colonial-era model of plantation production in Southeast Asia disciplined plants and people and, of most importance, the way that production relations between plants and people were conceived. This discipline was challenged during historic moments of crisis that stimulated the imagination of alternative modes of production. The analysis will focus on the histories of three plants in particular: black pepper (Piper nigrum), Para rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and a sword grass (Imperata cylindrica). Notable events in their histories include the proscription of pepper cultivation in the sixteenth century Hikayat Banjar in southeastern Borneo; the tribal dream of rice-eating rubber in the 1930s in western Borneo and the contemporaneous international effort to restrict smallholder rubber cultivation; and the lengthy history of productive native management of Imperata and disbelief in such management by plantation managers and government officials. Each case represents conflict between alternative and competing systems of crop management, which consists in part in transcendent exercises to imagine, or deny, alternative systems of production. These leaps of the imagination are nourished by a focus on the human-nonhuman divide, especially during historic moments of crisis."
"Believing the unbelieved: Reincarnation, cultural authority, and politics in the Trobriand Islands","In modern democracies, political parties are the vehicles through which new groups gain political entry. Are parties equally welcoming to all new activists, irrespective of their ethnicity? In a field experiment, we study the responsiveness of local party officials in Sweden who are being contacted by fictitious individuals who want to become active in the party. We find that party officials are more likely to respond, and give informative answers that use a warmer and more welcoming tone, when they are being contacted by an individual with a Swedish name than by an individual with an Arabic name. These discriminatory effects are mainly found when contacting parties on the rightmost end of the political spectrum but are unaffected by appeals to electoral gain, common ideology, and norms of democratic inclusion. Given the importance of parties as gateways into politics, our findings have troubling implications for equal representation."
Comment on “‘A Million Dollars in Free Advertising’: Politics and Sex Offense Prosecution in the Wake of Duke Lacrosse”,"Examining a government’s record is difficult. This is a problem for voters who want to hold governments accountable. One solution is for voters to hold governments accountable for changes in their personal welfare. Yet, it is often unclear whether changes in personal welfare are caused by government policies or voters’ own actions. Since voters have a desire to protect their self-image, this ambiguity might fuel a self-serving bias in attribution. That is, voters might take personal responsibility for positive changes in personal welfare and hold the government responsible for negative changes. Using data from election surveys and survey experiments, this article shows that voters attribute responsibility for personal welfare in this self-serving way. This hurts democratic accountability because voters do not reward governments (enough) for improving their personal welfare."
From ethics to politics,"Criminal justice contact is increasingly routine for Americans, and preemptive policing tactics render contact a feature of everyday life for minorities and the poor. Scholars interested in the impact of criminal justice contact on political outcomes largely find that all types of contact decrease voting and trust in government. Yet, qualitative evidence suggests that sometimes individuals are mobilized by their experiences. I leverage theoretical differences between custodial citizenship and having a loved one who is a custodial citizen, referred to as proximal contact, to identify the conditions under which criminal justice experiences catalyze political action. Individuals with proximal contact face fewer barriers to participation than do custodial citizens, and when they view negative experiences as a product of a system that targets people like them on the basis of group affiliation, contact can spur participation in activities other than voting."
"Chinese Perspectives on the International Rule of Law: Law and Politics in the One-Party State, by Matthieu Burnay","Images are important to campaigns that champion the rights of Muslim women against the gender inequalities that ostensibly inhere in Islam. The force of such images derives in part from their intended purpose to disrupt, evoke, or incite responses of compassion and solidarity. The temporal context that both produces and mandates these images, however, is also critical to their power. This article thus attempts to conceptualize and name this time, the time that permits and demands only certain images. The concept of secular humanitarian time is formulated to capture the politics and atmosphere that allow images to transform social and political contexts: an atmosphere in which some images of Muslim women are representable and others are not."
"Resisting “Law and Order” in California: Howard Moore Jr., Angela Davis, and the Politics of Prison Radicalism","This article examines identity production and reproduction discourses in the era of post-liberal order from the perspective of the countries located in the common neighborhood of Russia and the European Union. It goes beyond traditional geopolitical and security approaches to investigate Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan from a multidisciplinary framework, analyzing how their ontological selves are reproduced vis-à-vis the West-East nexus. Based on case studies of these three states, I claim that since the European Union does not play the role of region builder in the South Caucasus, the extent to which a discourse on one’s belonging to Europe is reproduced depends on the concrete short- or long-term incentives provided by the West. With no existing liberal regional institutional framework, the politics of the South Caucasus should be viewed through stigma theory, which helps to shed light on how the normative power of the European Union is perceived."
A Race to the Middle: The Politics of Interstate Cost Distribution and Welfare State Expansion,"There has been a growing affective intensity on Farsi social media around Iranian women’s rights protests, particularly mobilizations against the compulsory hijab. This intensity has crystallized into a variety of emotions: the anger, joy, and defiance of Iranian women protesting against the hijab inside the country; the outrage at the injustice these actions communicate; and the anger and anxiety of Iranian critics on both the Right and the Left, among both the Iranian establishment and ordinary people. Yet oversimplified counterpositions between “global” and “local,” West and East, dominate both legacy-media and social-media narratives of women’s rights campaigning, resulting, as I show, in the circulation of binary genres of “authentic” versus “inauthentic” protest that generate anger and anxiety. In this vein, the traumatic experience of economic sanctions, as the master signifier of West-East conflict in Iranian online exchanges, often frames human rights discourses as inauthentic, in that these discourses are positioned as emanating from the West. Understanding the politics of emotion around these mobilizations allows one to attend more closely to the contentions and fissures that traverse women’s struggles within Iran and, I argue, to develop a politics of affective recognition as a basis for constructing feminist solidarities across and within borders. A focus on anger and rage, among other feelings, helps us not only to trace the binary oppositions that characterize online discourses around these protests but to capture their unstable ambivalence between authenticity and inauthenticity, inside and outside, their potential to point beyond existing boundaries and demarcations, and to permit new imaginings of territoriality."
Rocking the Revolution: The Chicago Women’s Liberation Rock Band and the Politics of Feminist Rock and Roll,"In July 2016, during a closed session with Polish bishops, Pope Francis stated, “In Europe, America, Latin America, Africa, and in some countries of Asia, there are genuine forms of ideological colonization taking place. And one of these—I will call it clearly by its name—is [the ideology of] ‘gender.’” Several months later, in the Republic of Georgia, the pope publicly condemned gender discourse as the “great enemy” in a “global war” of ideas. Around the globe, religious and other conservative actors are intensifying their attacks on feminist and LGBTQ+ scholarship and activism, casting advocates as “gender feminists” promoting a radical “gender ideology.” Language deployed by the Vatican, such as gender ideology, gender theory, and genderism, has been captured by right-wing enthusiasts to thwart emancipatory gender agendas worldwide. This article examines antigender campaigns as palpable transnational countermovements and considers their use of gender ideology as salient counterstrategies to feminist and LGBTQ+ social movements. By situating antigenderism within countermovement theory, I show that recent antigender activity transcends isolated and uncoordinated instances of resistance and instead operates within sophisticated and well-organized countermovements to defeat feminist and LGBTQ+ policy. By conceptualizing antigenderism as a countermovement, I provide a useful framework for studying national and supranational antigenderism and for understanding the stakes in the tug-of-war among progressive social movements and countermovements for ontological and political control over the term “gender.”"
Are Conservatives Less Likely Than Liberals to Accept Welfare? The Psychology of Welfare Politics,"Can competent political leaders bring significant policy changes to communities otherwise doomed by “bad” informal institutions? This question has remained unanswered because of the lack of a convincing measure of politicians’ competence. I develop a novel survey technique to measure the administrative competence of executive politicians, and I apply it in interviews with 306 Italian mayors. I study the impact of mayors’ administrative competence on the policies they enact, using a difference-in-differences approach. Results show that more competent mayors are associated with better policies, but the association is only present in cases where the quality of informal institutions is low. In these municipalities, the election of more competent mayors translates into a more effective use of funds, an increase in long-term investments, and better service provision without an increase in taxes. Results hold across different measures of institutional quality."
"Abraham among the Tyrants: The Politics of Genesis 22 in George Buchanan’s Iephthes, sive votum and Abraham Cowley’s Davideis","In a time of contentious politics, it becomes conspicuous that studies of populism and of constituent power rarely mention one another. This is true despite the fact that “the people” are regularly asserted as the preferred political subject for populism and constituent power alike, pitting them against elites and even the constitution. But if opponents of populism are right that its appeal to the people’s will is normatively suspect, how do we ensure that their will—as the foundation of modern politics—is not undercut completely? I claim that the theory of constituent power can solve this dilemma through a comparison with populism that assesses their respective positions on political subjectivity and identity, political temporality, political will, and the appropriate kind of rule. Critics are wrong to depict either approach as intrinsically cynical and unprincipled. However, comparing their ontological assumptions confirms that constituent power offers a theoretically rich and complex frame for contentious politics, one that is superior to and reinforces concerns about populism, especially the kind of authoritarian populism—and its democratic masquerade—that is dominant today."
"Politics, Partage, and Papyri: Excavated Texts Between Cairo and Ann Arbor (1924–1953)","Seminal studies show that naive lab participants accurately predict who wins real-world elections based solely on candidate photos. It is unclear what this implies for the health of democracy without knowing whether candidates who look more electable or competent in photos behave more competently in office. This study brings novel performance data to this question and shows that voters can identify which politicians divert less public money and communicate more persuasively based solely on headshots. Such inferences do not predict politicians’ effort visiting their constituencies, but neither do other available metrics like professional qualifications. I implement these studies in a low-income country where ballots include candidate photos and where weak institutional checks raise the stakes for selecting innately competent leaders. Estimates provide an example of how voters’ use of heuristics need not harm democratic accountability, and can actually enhance it, in cases where these shortcuts identify traits associated with good governance."
Getting Rich Too Fast? Voters’ Reactions to Politicians’ Wealth Accumulation,"When do politicians in developing democracies prioritize meritocratic recruitment over patronage hiring for public sector jobs? I distinguish between low- and high-skilled positions and argue that the former are valuable for sustaining party machines, while manipulating the latter can undermine state performance. Accordingly, politicians will interfere to ensure their copartisans are hired to low-skilled jobs but select bureaucrats for high-skilled positions based on meritocratic criteria. I test my argument using novel bureaucrat-level data from Ghana (n=17,942) and leverage a change in the governing party to investigate hiring patterns. The results suggest that partisan bias is confined to low-ranked jobs. The findings shed light on the mixed effects of electoral competition on patronage identified in prior studies: competition may dissuade politicians from interfering in recruitment to high-ranked positions but encourage them to hire partisans for low-ranked positions."
Machiavelli: Italian Historiography and Politics,"A counterpart of what is known as “European exceptionalism”—political stability and institutional arrangement that enabled modern economic growth and political development—is a “Chinese anomaly.” This anomaly takes the form of a sharp contrast with premodern Europe: Chinese imperial rulers stayed in power longer than their European counterparts, but this political stability was accompanied by a high level of institutional stasis. In this article, we argue that a well-known Chinese institution, the civil service examination (CSE) system, contributed to China’s imperial longevity. We use detailed historical data on individual CSE performance to demonstrate the longevity-contributory mechanisms of CSE—constraining access to power by aristocrats and other wealth holders. We argue that a key to unpacking the so-called Chinese anomaly is to understand the role of bureaucracy in political development in China and potentially in other regions."
Why Do Voters Support Corrupt Politicians? Experimental Evidence from South Africa,"Many developing democracies suffer from persistent corruption and rule-of-law violations. Growing efforts have focused on establishing anticorruption institutions to combat this culture of impunity, but success has been modest. We tackle this puzzle by focusing on the calculus of the threatened corrupt elites in undermining serious anticorruption efforts. We examine electoral manipulation, as credible anticorruption reforms may increase pressure on corrupt elites to fraudulently maintain power in order to control anticorruption efforts. At the same time, anticorruption reforms can deter electoral manipulation if they sufficiently raise the costs of lawbreaking. Focusing on the representative case of Romania and using a variety of data sources, diagnostics and research designs, we show how credible anticorruption efforts systematically induce electoral manipulation by the backlash coalition of corrupt politicians. However, this manipulation is constrained by electoral competition, which may be the key to longer-term political consolidation of these “imperfect” democracies."
"The Antiquities Trade in Egypt 1880–1930. The H.O. Lange Papers, by Fredrik Hagen and Kim Ryholt; About Antiquities: Politics of Archaeology in the Ottoman Empire, by Zeynep Çelik","Dictators can choose not only whether to repress but also how to repress. This paper demonstrates that autocrats select their repressive methods based on the anticipated likelihood of responsive dissent. While dictators would prefer to use violence against their most prominent opposition, the more visible the opponent, the more likely their death or detention will provoke backlash. Instead, dictators can target these enemies with alternative methods of repression like exile. To test this theory, I draw on original data on the fates of candidates in the last elections before Chile’s coup. While elected politicians experienced more repression when accounting for exile, results—including those of a regression discontinuity—demonstrate that election decreased the likelihood of suffering violence. Evidence suggests that this is due to the increased prominence associated with winning office. My findings offer new insight into how autocrats avoid backlash, as well as when they adopt different repressive tools."
Neither Left Behind nor Superstar: Ordinary Winners of Digitalization at the Ballot Box,"The normative justification for separation of powers is canonically articulated in terms of liberty. However, critics of this justification claim that separation of powers either does not or is not necessary to protect liberty and therefore is obsolete. This article argues that separation of powers still has a valuable role to play in American politics, but not one articulable in terms of liberty. Instead, its value hinges on its potential to contribute to normative political legitimacy. I present the legitimacy model of separation of powers as an ideal to evaluate practice and assess proposed reforms. I build from political science work on conflictual constitutionalism to argue that the American separation of powers’ structure makes the branches differentially competent at identifying and considering certain types of reasons for actions. This makes it more likely that government decisions will be based on relevant reasons considered through appropriate procedures, which is a way to institutionalize a legitimacy-enhancing requirement that government treat those subject to its decisions according to an attitude that respects their autonomous capacities. The legitimacy model offers good theoretical reasons to affirm separation of powers’ potential value to contemporary political life."
"社運年代: 香港抗爭政治的軌跡 (An epoch of social movements: Trajectory of contentious politics in Hong Kong), edited by Edmund W. Cheng and Samson Wai-hei Yuen","This article evaluates the psychological pathways between war exposure and the formation of political tolerance in Sri Lanka after the civil war between 1983 and 2009. To date, little is known in the political science literature about the interplay between war experiences, their psychological footprints, and the formation of political tolerance. Using survey data from 2016, we are able to evaluate the psychological consequences of war experiences, differentiating between the issues of both war-related distress and posttraumatic growth. Our results based on path models reveal that war exposure does not uniformly damage political tolerance: experiences of posttraumatic growth, a highly discussed phenomenon, are able to increase an individual’s probability of granting basic civil liberties to an opposing group."

The Worlds of Positivism: A Global Intellectual History, 1770–1930.","In this paper I consider the “Jeffersonian problem”: whether one generation has the right to bind future generations to an inherited constitutional order. Thomas Jefferson’s challenge rests on fundamental democratic principles of equality and consent, and therefore—while there may be substantial pragmatic reasons to be wary of his argument—any response must also remain true to those moral ideals. I argue that through the crisis of slavery and the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was compelled to revisit the basis of the American political regime, and in doing so articulated a conception of democratic politics that answers Jefferson’s challenge. He does so in two ways: first, Lincoln’s political religion revives reverence for the ancestral in a democratic context; second, Lincoln’s concept of rededication allows each generation to affirm that revered past while simultaneously manifesting its own sovereign power through novel applications of past principle. I conclude by arguing that the inclusion of generational obligations is essential to democratic politics and that Lincoln’s approach provides the best means of doing so."
From Sovereignty to Solidarity: Some Transformations in the Politics of Sacrifice from the Reformation to Robertson Smith,"Field experiments are a growing part of the research political scientists conduct. Several features make the subnational level an attractive place to conduct field experiments, particularly experiments designed to test for information effects. In this essay I discuss several ways to facilitate further field experimentation. I end the essay with a series of suggestions on how researchers can find partners interested in collaborating on conducting field experiments."

The Science and Politics of Race in Mexico and the United States, 1910–1950.","Studies routinely find that women have lower levels of political knowledge than men. This gender gap is usually interpreted as troublesome for democracy, because a lack of political knowledge could imply that women’s participation in politics is less effective and that their interests will be represented less well than those of men. In this short article, we present a direct test of the assumption that women are less effective voters because of this lack of political knowledge. We make use of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data to study gender differences in proximity voting and correct voting. Our results do not suggest that women vote less correctly than men—a conclusion that prompts important questions about the role of different forms of political knowledge and the seemingly gendered nature of the vote choice."
African Youth on the Move in Postwar Greater France: Experiential Knowledge and Decolonial Politics at the End of the Empire,"This paper examines Islamist political commentary on the Arab Spring produced by activist-intellectuals affiliated with the Islamist non-governmental organization (NGO) Özgür-Der and the monthly Haksöz in Turkey. Contemporary Islamist intellectual discourses have often been studied instrumentally by scholars as providing a window onto Islamist (party) politics, almost always discussed in relation to Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (AKP) rule. Against this background, I explore the understudied political-theoretic significance of this intellectual activism by focusing on the interpretative practices that underpin Islamist theses on the political present. I argue that reading the Arab Spring as a Qutbian event, as do Hamza Türkmen and fellow activists at Özgür-Der, is productive of political effects that entail the continual (re)invention of an Islamic revivalist canon of thought in Turkey as “our” past, Qutb as native, and the reading public as authentically Islamic. Islamist commentary does this political work by way of two interpretative strategies: critically updating the ideas of Islamist revivalist thinkers for present circumstances, and appropriating its translated (hence foreign) source material as native. Exploring these political effects, I argue, reveals the affinity of Islamist intellectual activism with academic political theory, and provides new insights on Islamism, the Arab Spring, as well as the study of political thought."
"“Water Fit for a Christian Woman”: The Gendered and Racial Politics of Water in the Wash, 1865–1921","Three decades ago Huckfeldt and Sprague hypothesized that partisan context constrains information sharing between neighbors. We develop their theory to identify implications for campaign mobilization in homogeneous and mixed-partisan contexts. We argue that get-out-the-vote (GOTV) spillover effects should vary with the proportion of rival party supporters in a neighborhood. Using two samples of households that were either included or excluded prerandom assignment from a street-level GOTV experiment, we test this expectation of differential spillover effects. We estimate neighborhood party preferences using targeting data made available by the UK Labour Party. We find that spillover effects on party supporters are smaller in neighborhoods that include larger shares of rival party supporters. Rival partisans are mobilized in mixed-partisan neighborhoods where the probability of spillovers from mixed-partisan households is higher. This article extends Huckfeldt and Sprague’s theory and demonstrates the importance of social dynamics for parties’ campaign strategies."
"Legacies of Space and Intangible Heritage: Archaeology, Ethnohistory, and the Politics of Cultural Continuity in the Americas by Fernando Armstrong-Fumero and Julio Hoil Gutierrez, eds.","In this article, we analyze a series of feminist protests that have taken place within larger political mobilizations in South Africa. Specifically, we are interested in on- and offline activism that challenges norms of gendered violence and is led by young feminists. These protests were among those that received the widest media coverage in 2015 and 2016, shaping public discourse against sexual violence in South Africa. We focus here on three protests that included the use of Twitter hashtags—#RapeAtAzania, #RUReferencelist, and #RememberKhwezi—indicating a new reliance among young, educated feminists on social media for organizational, informational, and activist purposes. Using media articles and Twitter posts related to these hashtags, we analyze the ways and means through which some young feminists speak out against sexual violence in South Africa today. We ask how these new types of actions might interact with existing antiviolence and feminist movements in South Africa. Although sexual violence has long plagued South African society, young feminists today are engaging and identifying with this highly politicized issue on personal grounds. Via social media they reveal their own encounters with sexual violence, expose silences that accompany rape, and call for an “unforgetting” of the stories of rape survivors."
"Plants, Politics, and the Imagination over the Past 500 Years in the Indo-Malay Region","A persistent question in the study of American political history has been the capacity of one-party government in the American South to represent its voting citizens. In this article, we use county-level returns from prohibition referendums to create measures of citizen preferences for prohibition at the legislative district level for both the South and the non-South. We then examine the relationship between these preferences and roll call votes on alcohol-related issues in the US House and on votes to ratify the Eighteenth Amendment in state legislatures. We find strong relationships between preferences and roll call voting in both the North and South and find no consistent evidence that responsiveness is higher or lower in the South than the North. This indicates that, on at least one salient issue, a competitive party system was not a precondition for legislative representation in the one-party South."
Everyday forgiveness: The practice and politics of mercy,"In Mao’s era, China’s policy makers and intellectuals viewed aesthetic experience and thought as handmaidens in the service of the political order. As China opened up and engaged more intensely with modern traditions of the West, aesthetic thinkers such as Li Zehou critiqued the subordinated role of aesthetics and reasserted notions of aesthetic autonomy and liberal humanism, calling for the separation of arts and literature from political, social, and moral concerns. This truncated aesthetic view stems from a modernist version of Western aesthetics that favors sense and sensibility as the sole sources of aesthetic value—a view that considerably diminishes the horizon of concerns inherent in traditional and modern Chinese aesthetic thoughts. This article seeks to recapture a repoliticized aesthetics by considering the ways early twentieth-century Chinese thinkers linked aesthetic thoughts to moral and political considerations in the reconstruction of China as a modern nation-state. Instead of transcendent, pure aesthetics over and above political processes and social experience, prominent aesthetic thinkers like Wang Guowei, Cai Yuanpei, and Lu Xun invoked traditional Chinese aesthetic legacies and reconsidered intimate and necessary ties between aesthetic categories and broader concerns about cultural crises, moral reform, and nation building."
"Dust Bowls of Empire: Imperialism, Environmental Politics, and the Injustice of “Green” Capitalism. by Hannah Holleman; Legacies of Dust: Land Use and Labor on the Colorado Plains. by Douglas Sheflin","My aim in this article is both to identify and move beyond what I argue is a dominant interpretive practice in feminist debates on gender and culture: centering liberalism as a condition of and for feminist interventions. This preoccupation with liberalism constitutes a method of inquiry in and of itself, functioning as a starting point for scholarly work: liberalism has become a textual anchor in the gender/culture debate. Where scholars rely on liberalism as a point of departure for analysis, divisions between liberal/nonliberal, West/non-West, will unavoidably be established at the outset. This has problematic consequences for the ways in which scholars are able to respond not only to each other but also to the appropriation of feminist discourses by the state and in public deliberations—from the recent “travel ban” in the United States to the “burkini ban” in France. I offer an alternative to this entrenched vocabulary through a comparative textual analysis of two authors: Susan Moller Okin and Saba Mahmood. I first illustrate how a shared reliance on liberalism locks both authors in an oppositional binary between liberal West and nonliberal non-West. To unsettle this framework, I show that suspending their reliance on a liberal referent reveals points for negotiation between their considerations of autonomy, selfhood, and deliberation. These opportunities for negotiation are precisely what get buried beneath their mutual focus on liberalism. My reading thus suggests that possibilities for cross-cultural collaboration might well require a shift beyond feminist preoccupations with liberalism."
Welcome to the Party? Ethnicity and the Interaction between Potential Activists and Party Gatekeepers,"This essay analyzes the current protests in Hong Kong from the perspective of the friends/enemies dialectic. It depicts the opposed political positions involved in the protests, considers the relations of these positions to ethnic and linguistic identities in Hong Kong, and analyzes the protests through a case study of the politics and identities of a woman who immigrated to Hong Kong from Mainland China thirty years ago. The essay concludes by considering both the necessity and limitations of analyzing political actions through the lens of friends and enemies. It also introduces the other essays in this Currents collection of articles about protests in Hong Kong."
How Do Voters Hold Politicians Accountable for Personal Welfare? Evidence of a Self-Serving Bias,"The object of this article is to contextualize Mary Daly’s mixed reception within feminist scholarship in order to read her status within the larger project(s) of feminist thought in recent history. Daly is a polarizing figure who inspires enmity, devotion, and trenchant criticism. I track these responses, arguing that they offer an important source for the intellectual history of feminist thought. Daly’s work is mystical and polemical, proudly separatist and essentialist. As such, she has enjoyed the devotion of those who embrace her Wiccan-inspired manifestos. However, over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, Daly’s work received two core critiques. The first came in 1980 in the form of excoriating public criticism from Audre Lorde, who charged Daly with racism. While Lorde shared Daly’s desire to recuperate a goddess tradition for the purposes of feminist devotions, she was perturbed that Daly drew only from the Western tradition in her construction of a new pantheon, neglecting long histories of goddess worship in Africa. As the eighties wore on, Daly also became synonymous with the reductive excesses of what Alice Echols and Linda Alcoff call “cultural feminism,” so named because it calls for a countercultural feminine and feminist project devoted to an ideology of reverence for the female nature. This politics, as Alcoff describes it, argues that “Feminist theory, the explanation of sexism, and the justification of feminist demands can all be grounded securely and unambiguously on the concept of the essential female.” As a result of these critiques, Daly has been designated as standing for both racism and essentialism. As exhibit A for these perceived sins, Daly’s work has been a site of continual correction in feminist scholarship. This article offers an intellectual history of Daly’s correction, attempting to isolate the stakes at play in each of those moments. The object of this article is not to recuperate Daly’s thought per se but to historicize her reception within a larger story of the making of feminist orthodoxies."

Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2018. xii + 280 pp. Illustrations, maps, notes, and index. Cloth $90.00, paper $32.95.","In modern American politics, legislators fund-raise extensively on behalf of their parties. Under what conditions do parties develop systems to incentivize this fund-raising? Previous research has focused primarily on Congress, making it difficult to explain how systems of caucus fund-raising develop and change. This article takes advantage of a new source of evidence: the state legislatures. Using original data linking state legislators to leadership political action committees and campaign committees over a 12 year period, I show that competition for majority status leads legislators to contribute more to party organizations and candidates. This effect is driven partly by parties in competitive chambers selecting committee chairs on the basis of members’ contributions. Parties are only able to institute these systems when leadership is granted control over resources such as chair appointments, however. These findings clarify when and how money plays an influential role in legislative politics."
Targeted: The Mobilizing Effect of Perceptions of Unfair Policing Practices,"Many feminists theorize backlash as reactionary opposition to progressive gains by those seeking to reestablish the status quo. This essay extends this theorization by raising and answering two related questions: where does backlash come from, and what does backlash do? I argue that backlash emerges from the resurgence of questions regarding who belongs in the polity and that these questions about proper membership are reflected in contemporary conservative discourse that casts certain groups, such as migrants, Muslims, and women—especially transgender women—as outsiders. Backlash thus functions at the level of physical violence as well as existential threat. I illustrate these arguments by focusing on two cases: a personal narrative of backlash I experienced shortly after the 2016 election and an intersectional analysis of rhetoric used by conservative commentator Milo Yiannopolous in two televised appearances that took place in 2017."
Vox Populi: Popular Politics before Liberal Democracy,"Covert forms of authoritarian control remain an understudied strategy of authoritarian survival. This article uses the infiltration of the Catholic Church with secret collaborators in communist Poland to study the drivers and consequences of such covert forms of control. We theorize that subnational variation in communist infiltration is driven by differences in organizational vulnerability following World War II. In turn, we argue that the uneven degree of infiltration with proregime agents shaped the subsequent effectiveness of the Church to foster anticommunist attitudes. We test these predictions against competing explanations (including imperial legacies and modernization) by analyzing seven Polish surveys from the late communist period (1985–89). Our results confirm the importance of organizational vulnerability in driving the success of communist infiltration efforts and suggest that infiltration with secret agents was effective in undermining the Church’s ability to shape the political attitudes of frequent churchgoers."
Imagining Muslim Women in Secular Humanitarian Time,"Originally published in 1991, Susan Faludi’s Backlash: The Undeclared War against American Women is a landmark feminist work. In this interview, Faludi reflects on the evolution of the feminist struggle for women’s equality in the years since this book was published. Identifying our present moment as another period of backlash, Faludi argues that a counterassault is again on the rise. Yet Faludi notes that unlike the subtler backlash of the 1980s, a more overt and aggressive resurgent misogyny characterizes the Trump era. Faludi also draws parallels and distinctions between the allegations during the confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas in the 1990s and Justice Brett Kavanaugh during the #MeToo moment. Expanding on her earlier account, Faludi discusses the connections between backlash, class cleavages, and racism, and explains that once again minority and working-class women are paying the steepest price as feminist gains are eroded."
The East in the West: South Caucasus Between Russia and the European Union,"This article discusses a variety of major explanations for the intensity of recent protests in Arab states and investigates whether there is empirical support for them. We survey various political, economic, and social factors and develop a comprehensive empirical model to estimate the structural determinants of protests in 19 Arab League states between 1990 and 2011, measured using events data. The results show that protests were stronger in countries with higher inflation, higher levels of corruption, lower levels of freedom, and more use of the internet and cell phones. Protests were also more frequent in countries with partial democracies and factional politics. We find no evidence for the common argument that the surge in protests in 2011 was linked to a bulge in the youth population. Overall, we conclude that these economic, political, and social variables help to explain which countries had stronger protest movements, but that they cannot explain the timing of those revolts. We suggest that a contagion model can help explain the quick spread of protests across the region in 2011, and we conduct a preliminary test of that possibility."
Digital Feminism beyond Nativism and Empire: Affective Territories of Recognition and Competing Claims to Suffering in Iranian Women’s Campaigns,"Why do citizens rely on partisan cues when forming political judgments? We assess the relative importance of two motives for partisan cue-following using a series of survey experiments. We find no support for the bounded rationality hypothesis that cue receptivity is highest among citizens with low cognitive resources. Meanwhile, we find mixed support for the expressive utility hypothesis that cue receptivity is highest among people with both a strong partisan social identification and high cognitive resources. The strength of this latter evidence varies across studies, cognitive resource measures, and cue condition comparisons. The results suggest that partisan cue receptivity more often involves an effort to harness cognitive resources for the goal of identity expression than an effort to compensate for low cognitive resources."
Unpacking “Gender Ideology” and the Global Right’s Antigender Countermovement,"Scholars, pundits, and political reformers have long worried that corporations distort public policy and subvert the will of the electorate by donating to politicians. Well-publicized anecdotes notwithstanding, whether and how much corporations actually benefit from supporting political candidates remains unknown. To systematically address this question, we utilize two complementary empirical approaches that isolate the monetary benefits a company derives from a favored candidate winning office. First, we use a regression discontinuity design exploiting close congressional, gubernatorial, and state legislative elections. Second, we leverage within-campaign changes in market beliefs about the outcomes of US Senate races. We find no evidence that corporations benefit from electing candidates supported by their PACs, and we can statistically reject effect sizes greater than 0.3% of firm value. Our results suggest that corporate campaign contributions do not buy significant political favors—at least not on average."

Usually perceived as a model democracy, Switzerland already experienced declining turnout rates from the 1960s onward, which worried elites and gave way to a political demand for expertise on nonvoting. Focusing on scientific studies and media pieces, this article charts the emergence of various (and possibly conflicting) forms of knowledge and interpretative frameworks on electoral turnout in postwar Switzerland, as well as their circulation in the public sphere and their potential influence on political action. Against all odds, the numerous academic and commercial studies dedicated to this topic did little to quell the relative helplessness of politicians and journalists. In fact, the decline in turnout fundamentally challenged dominant representations of civic behavior and political participation, which centered on voting and was modeled on the ideal of a (male) citizen-soldier."
Politics and Policy by Other Means,"As studies using macrolevel evidence have shown, citizens are more satisfied with democracy when they feel that their instrumental preferences are represented in government, and this feeling is more likely in nonmajoritarian institutional contexts. Scholars have given less attention to whether such institutions also increase satisfaction by providing more inclusive political discourse. Citizens may value having their voice represented in politics, regardless of the resulting authority. This article presents the first microlevel evidence of this mechanism by having subjects experience a simulated election campaign that manipulates both the political discourse and the outcome independently. We find that subjects were less satisfied with democracy when their party lost the election, but this effect disappeared when the campaign discourse featured thorough discussion of an issue that they felt was important. The findings suggest that institutions and party systems that provide more diverse voices may soften the blow of losing elections."
Can Good Politicians Compensate for Bad Institutions? Evidence from an Original Survey of Italian Mayors,"This paper exploits an original database that spans 30-plus developed and developing nations between 1870 and 2010 to perform the first empirical analysis of the relationship between historical levels of intra-elite competition and fiscal development over the long run. We argue that the timing of industrialization affects the extent of historical competition between agricultural and capitalist elites, which in turn helps shape key initial decisions over fiscal size and structure. Under “early” industrialization, intra-elite competition levels tended to be greater, promoting fiscal development characterized by high overall taxation and tax progressivity. Under “late” industrialization, by contrast, agricultural elites were more likely to retain political dominance, promoting fiscal states characterized by low overall taxation and tax regressivity. We show evidence for a positive, statistically significant, and robust relationship between historical intra-elite competition levels and long-run fiscal development. This focus on intra-elite competition improves our understanding of the fundamental determinants of cross-national fiscal differences today."
Power and Politics in America’s Private Governments,"Recent Hobbes scholarship argues that legal rationalism is the key to understanding his concept of representation; the commonwealth entails the sum total of the individual wills who compact to create it. But as jurist Carl Schmitt recognized, certain aspects of Hobbes’s famous Leviathan narrative transcend this rationality. He points out that the commonwealth, according to Hobbes, constitutes a “real unity” of the multitude in one Sovereign head rather than a simple aggregation of individuals, suggesting that something supernatural, in addition to legal rationality, undergirds Hobbes’s concept of representation. This article argues that Thomas Hobbes was invoking an alternative, theological notion of representation along with that of legal authorization. The prototype of this theological representation is the relationship of Jesus Christ to the members of his church-body, a familiar image to seventeenth-century English Christians. The work of twentieth-century theologian Karl Barth helps to explain this concept in detail, and, with Schmitt, reveals the continued significance of theological representation for modern politics as well as for religion."
Justifying Constituent Power in an Age of Populism,"Voting advice applications (VAAs) are voter information tools that millions of individuals have used in recent elections throughout the world. However, little is known about how they affect political behavior. Until now, observational studies of VAA have produced inconclusive results. Here we present the results from a randomized field experiment in Switzerland that estimates the causal effects of VAA use on voters’ vote intentions. Our results suggest that usage of the Swiss VAA smartvote strengthened the vote intention for the most preferred party and also increased the number of parties considered as potential vote options. These results imply that VAAs can influence voting behavior and that they can play an important role in electoral politics."
Snap Judgments: Predicting Politician Competence from Photos,"If indeed aestheticization and enchantment are perennial traits of state discourses and practices in China, it is perhaps unsurprising that a countertradition in modern literature should emphasize disenchantment. Cultural productions that originate from outside the sphere of the state have often questioned its authority. Where the state seeks to enchant, literature has sometimes sought to kindle doubt, to arouse debate. Although such debates have often been curtailed or suppressed, it is worth reexamining the connections between literary production and political debates in different historical contexts throughout twentieth-century China. Drawing on theories that stress the intentionality of literature and the speech act value of the literary text, the present essay attempts to characterize the communicational dynamics both within the text and in the context of its reception. In this perspective, it revisits some of the literary debates that took place in China in the May Fourth and Republican periods (represented by Lu Xun), the early postwar years and the ROC—PRC transition (Lao She), in certain works written during the Cultural Revolution (Jin Fan/Liu Qingfeng), as well as post-1979 literature on the mainland (Yan Lianke). It does so by selecting texts that seem to have been produced with the intention of challenging the aesthetics of enchantment, using literary devices to interrupt readers’ enjoyment and thus open a space for public discussion of both aesthetics and politics."
Combining Patronage and Merit in Public Sector Recruitment,"This essay defines Maoism as an experiment in intimate governance and an attempt—albeit a failed one—to dismantle the divide between political leaders and ordinary people. The Communist Party’s claim to intimacy with the people needs to be constantly reenacted in the relationship between party cadres and ordinary citizens––a cadre’s gestures, habits, and attitudes are magnified and scrutinized under the lens of party legitimacy. The special privileges (tequan, 特权) of party leaders are what I call metrics of exceptionality, which separate the party from the people. The promise to govern on the basis of intimacy with the people did not eradicate ruling class entitlements and arrogance but delegitimized them and opened them up to public scrutiny. Although the process of eradicating privileges was always several steps behind their elaboration and intensification, the former was a normative goal that shaped how ordinary citizens perceived and interacted with party cadres. This dual movement in opposing directions still constitutes the fundamental contradiction of China’s political system as seen from within. This essay revisits and examines crucial historical junctures in the People’s Republic of China as framed by popular contestations of special privilege. The fact that in the post-Mao period, party leaders still speak in the language of intimacy, proximity, and distance indicates the aesthetic importance of this relationship in party ideology, despite public complaints regarding its absence. Even when intimacy as a political mode of communication is able to communicate nothing but its own failure, the proximity between the party and the people takes center stage as the aesthetic foundation of party legitimacy."
"Billionaires, Organizations, and Federalism: Developments in the Study of American Inequality","The geohistorical disjunctures between Hong Kong—colonial territory, global city, and special administrative region—and China challenge understandings of the relationship. Hong Kong officially maintains certain core values that differ from those of the People’s Republic of China, while unofficial Chinese Communist Party united-front activity in Hong Kong has arguably narrowed the range of the sayable, in Jacques Rancière’s terms, in the public sphere. How does this admixture of core values, at turns antithetical and contested, appear in the space and time of Hong Kong? Interventions in the ideational dynamic between the city and the state—through images, utterances, performances, and alternative artworks—produce space for the appearance of subjects defined by the people. Not a postcolonial culture of disappearance but an ontology of politics where spaces of disagreement make apprehensible that which is politically unsayable. During the decade before the Umbrella Movement, in a fervent aesthetics of politics at the crossroads of hurtling urban transformation and accelerating illiberal governance, alternative art in Hong Kong populated social-movement activity with claims on public space and the possibilities of the people in the sightlines of a democratic future."
How to Save Democracy,"I develop a model of emigration and collective action to illustrate that the presence of exit opportunities can undermine political mobilization. In a setting where collective action is risky and where success requires the participation of a large number of citizens, exit options reduce mobilization through two mechanisms. First, profitable migration opportunities raise the opportunity cost of collective action, dampening political participation among those who could migrate. In addition, the knowledge that some individuals have profitable exit options lowers everyone’s confidence that collective action can be successful. Because of this, all people—regardless of whether they personally could migrate—become less likely to mobilize as exit options become more profitable or more prevalent, undermining collective action and making successful mobilization less likely. I examine the mechanisms suggested by the model using historical evidence from Mexico and Japan and discuss the implications for understanding the political economy of emigration and of emigration policy."
A Longevity Mechanism of Chinese Absolutism,"Affirmative action policies are often adopted in unexpected places, at unexpected times, and by unlikely groups of policymakers. To help reconcile these anomalies, I offer a theory of affirmative action, one that accounts for the proliferation of these policies according to lawmakers’ distinct partisan interests to manipulate political competition in pursuit of political office and control of the state. I identify four distinct logics that vary depending on whether affirmative action increases or decreases competition, and whether it exploits competition within the party itself or elsewhere. I illustrate the various efforts of party leaders to manipulate political competition by using four case studies from India, South Africa, and the United States. These findings help to explain why citizens in constitutional democracies regularly find themselves debating the fairness of these policies, despite their controversial nature."
Anticorruption Efforts and Electoral Manipulation in Democracies,"We theorize that direct social lobbying—the meeting of a lobbyist and public official outside of a formal office—persuades officials to support publicly policies favored by interest groups. Social lobbying influences public officials because the social environment allows for greater receptivity to interest group messages. A randomized field experiment was conducted by a lobbying firm in a US state legislature. Legislators randomly assigned to be socially lobbied more frequently expressed public support for the interest group’s preferred policy than did legislators lobbied in their offices or not contacted by the lobbyist. In addition, an original survey of registered lobbyists was conducted in 10 US states demonstrating that social lobbying regularly occurs. Political elites are influenced by the social environment; interest group direct lobbying is influential when conducted in places not easily observed by the public."
Anticipating Dissent: The Repression of Politicians in Pinochet’s Chile,"Voter turnout still receives considerable attention in electoral studies. Recently, there have been numerous investigations of a neglected determinant, sometimes labeled “patrimony” and here labeled “wealth.” This variable, measuring how much wealth a voter has, appears to help account for party choice, beyond more usual socioeconomic measures. However, as yet we know little about how wealth affects voter turnout. In this article, we explore the relationship of wealth to voter turnout, using a battery of questions on wealth, administered in 28 nations, from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). We observe that more wealth corresponds to higher voting turnout. Further, the strength of this link compares favorably to that of more traditional measures, such as income and education. Theoretically, such a sharp empirical result suggests expanding the resource model of electoral participation in order to include this less traditional, but more encompassing, measure of economic status."
"Separation of Powers: Legitimacy, Not Liberty","What is the effect of residing in ethnic enclaves on immigrants’ future political participation? We study a comprehensive refugee placement reform that was implemented in Sweden in the mid-1980s in combination with unique individual-level turnout data to study the causal effect of being settled in neighborhoods with a high residential concentration of coethnics on immigrants’ future probability of voting. We find little evidence that ethnic concentration per se affects voter turnout. On average, newly arrived immigrants were equally likely to vote whether they were placed in a neighborhood with many or few coethnics. Further analyses, however, indicate that the effect of ethnic concentration depends on the degree of political integration among previously settled coethnics; ethnic concentration increases turnout among the newly immigrated when they are placed with already politically integrated coethnics. These results underscore the conditions under which the political socialization of immigrant newcomers is enhanced in ethnic enclaves."
"The Tolerance of Tamils: War-Related Experiences, Psychological Pathways, and the Probability of Granting Civil Liberties to Former Enemies","This paper aims to contribute to the decolonization and Indigenization of democratic theory. Regarding decolonization, I explain that democratic self-determination is typically associated with sovereign autonomy and can serve to justify policies and discourses of settler colonial control, erasure, and assimilation. Regarding Indigenization, I reconceptualize democratic self-determination from an Indigenous starting point. I discuss the Two Row Wampum of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and offer an account of the political principles it embodies. I interpret it as advancing a relational conception of democratic autonomy, which makes it possible to embrace a plurality of political arrangements and political actors, to blur the distinction between internal authority and external sovereignty, and to de-emphasize the enforcement of decisions in favor of the maintenance of commitments to a political relationship."
The Power of Visibility: Advances in LGBT Rights in the United States and Europe,"Contemporary models of patriotism struggle to reconcile robust political partiality with universal norms of justice. This article defends an alternative account of ethical patriotism based on Thomas Aquinas’s virtue of pietas, or dutiful respect towards country and fellow citizens. Aquinas’s sensitivity to the sociopolitical context of human development leads him to defend patriotism as an associative obligation. Yet he avoids the moral particularism or skepticism characteristic of most defenses of strong patriotism by presenting norms of justice as preconditions of common life, upon which the long-term stability of positive law depends. Consequently, the virtue of pietas takes an aspirational form; it aims not to preserve a flawed status quo, but to preserve political features that give distinctive shape to a political community while simultaneously pressing the regime to reground positive laws on a foundation of natural right."
“My Ancient Faith”: Abraham Lincoln’s Response to the Jeffersonian Problem,"This article investigates the entangled history of the propaganda battles waged during World War II, focusing on Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States. It asks how and to what extent these three political regimes conceptualized propaganda as a knowledge-based practice and what kind of expertise they mobilized. Although American propaganda strategists were the only ones to make use of modern social science methods as part of their activities, under the difficult circumstances of ongoing war operations, the practices of knowledge production by military intelligence did not fundamentally differ between the three countries. The war profoundly changed the way knowledge was systematically mobilized for political and military purposes, and transnational entanglements, perceptions, and observations (but also misperceptions and projections) played a crucial role in that development. This directly connects World War II developments to the emergence of a Cold War regime of producing and using scientific knowledge for strategic purposes."
Facilitating Field Experiments at the Subnational Level,"“Grandfathering” grants preferential treatment to existing resource users over new entrants based on prior use. Grandfathering is based on the concept of first-in-time or prior appropriation and has been applied to a broad range of environmental and resource issues. We synthesize legal, economic, and political science perspectives and find that grandfathering removes incentives for users to anticipate regulations with proactive abatement. We analyze institutions ranging from long-enduring common-property regimes to climate negotiations to identify how grandfathering can be detrimental to sustainability, but we also show that it can be the only possible mechanism for bringing stakeholders to the table."
Deploying Tradition,"Since 2013, Brazil has undergone various moments of political turbulence, ultimately culminating in the seizure of power by the Far Right. The lack of clarity on how this movement has been led and the role played by the military in the political arena allows us to ask if Brazil has been the target of a form of hybrid warfare—similar to the kind experienced by various other countries that have undergone sudden changes in regime (such as Ukraine and Egypt, and more recently Honduras and Paraguay). This article explores the limits and implications of applying the notion of hybrid warfare to the Brazilian case, seeking to understand how politics came to be merged with elements adopted from military strategies and tactics. Based on my own ethnographic experience with military personnel, I aim to show how, with the assistance of other state powers, they produced a high-impact psychological operation that paved the way for the 2018 elections and the seizure of power by the Far Right. Following this line of analysis, I argue that in the Brazilian case, there has been a hybrid warfare as well as an insurgency of state corporations and their networks."
Concluding Analysis,"Populism is best understood as a symptom of growing dissatisfaction with democracy, which emerges when citizens believe that political institutions are unwilling or unable to respond to their needs and demands. In democracies, unlike in dictatorships, dissatisfied citizens can express their dissatisfaction by voting to change their leaders and governments. But if citizens believe their votes do not matter—if their leaders and governments do not respond to their needs and demands—then dissatisfaction with democracy will grow, as will support for movements opposed to it. This symposium contribution illustrates this dynamic via an examination of Europe’s past and present."
Hybrid warfare in Brazil: The highest stage of the military insurgency,"Parties rely on brokers to win elections in much of the developing world. How do parties use compensation to motivate these grassroots agents? Parties often decentralize broker payment decisions to local party elites. In addition to helping their party win elections, local elites seek personal career advancement. Because local elites typically rely on brokers’ support to advance, they have an incentive to use payments to strengthen their ties to brokers. Using a multiwave survey, we track the full range of payments to over 1,000 brokers from Ghana’s ruling party—the party most capable of distributing patronage benefits—across an electoral cycle. We show that the party operates a hybrid payment system missed by previous studies. The party rewards the brokers who deliver the most votes immediately after elections. But long after campaigns, when most payments are made, local party elites prioritize payments to brokers with upward connections to elites."
"Populism is a Symptom Rather than a Cause: Democratic Disconnect, the Decline of the Center-Left, and the Rise of Populism in Western Europe","Political scientists have acknowledged the importance of nationalism as a constitutive element of radical-right politics but have typically empirically reduced the phenomenon to specific out-group sentiments. Sociologists, in contrast, have devoted more attention to theorizing and operationalizing nationalism but have only sporadically engaged in debates about institutional politics. The present study brings these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents’ voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, in both the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the past 20 years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood. These trends point to the rising demand for radical candidates among Republicans and suggest a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages that serve to reinforce partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal democratic institutions."
Motivating the Machine: Which Brokers Do Parties Pay?,"Drawing on empirical evidence from history and anthropology, we aim to demonstrate that there is room for genealogical ideology critique within normative political theory. The test case is some libertarians’ use of folk notions of private property rights in defense of the legitimacy of capitalist states. Our genealogy of the notion of private property shows that asking whether a capitalist state can emerge without violations of self-ownership cannot help settling the question of its legitimacy, because the notion of private property presupposed by that question is a product of the entity it is supposed to help legitimize: the state. We anchor our genealogical critique in recent work on ideology in epistemology and philosophy of language and in current debates on the methodology of political theory. But, unlike more traditional approaches that aim to debunk whole concepts or even belief systems, we propose a more targeted, argument-specific form of ideology critique."
Democratic Philosophy,"Three themes emerge from this symposium. First, populism is largely shaped by (and is influencing) mainstream party political competition. Second, it has gained opportunities because of the economic policy decisions of governments regarding market reforms and liberal flows of labor and capital. Third, it is shaped by international forces such as the European Union. The symposium calls for further analyses of immigration, the fusion of cultural and economic threats, and what some call the “illiberal international.”"
"Chinese Migrant Workers and Employer Domination: Comparisons with Hong Kong and Vietnam, by Kaxton Siu","Beginning in the 1990s, a number of elite Chinese intellectuals developed new critiques of liberalism. Within the orbit of Marxism, a group often called the “new left” mainly concentrated on economic liberalism and inequalities of wealth. Some of them also showed an affinity with the views of intellectuals referred to as statists. The statists’ three main ideas can be summarized as the superiority of political sovereignty over the rule of law, a critique of the “judicialization” of politics and the need to “repoliticize” the state, and a critique of universalism and an assertion of Chinese exceptionalism. Some of the legal scholars who developed these ideas are directly influenced by Carl Schmitt (1888–1985), an authoritarian German legal scholar and political theorist. Important texts by the current Chinese group of statist thinkers provide an intellectual background to the recent evolution in Party ideology."
The Partisan Sorting of “America”: How Nationalist Cleavages Shaped the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election,"Discretion is fundamental to understanding interbranch interactions in the US separation-of-powers system. Yet, measuring discretion is challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both delegation and constraint in a consistent way over time. In this article, we propose a novel measure of executive discretion based on legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by spending limitations imposed by Congress in appropriations committee reports. We provide evidence for the validity of the measure, including a test of the ally principle to establish construct validity. Finally, we demonstrate the wider utility of the measure by employing it to evaluate hypotheses about how political control over the bureaucracy influences congressional policy making in the context of discretion. We show that agency design and presidential control are important factors in congressional decisions. Overall, we present a versatile measure of discretion that researchers can use to explore a variety of questions in American politics."
"Property, Legitimacy, Ideology: A Reality Check","Seeing the United States as a model for laissez-faire economies discourages research on the distinctive features of the U.S. political economy. The conventional view is that the U.S. economy suffers from chronic coordination problems, in which market actors engage in arm’s-length transactional relationships. This article challenges such generalization by delving into an unexplored tripartite experiment conducted by Labor Secretary Arthur Goldberg during the Kennedy administration in the early 1960s through the President’s Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy (LMAC). The experiment was a product of policy entrepreneurs’ attempts to tackle the decline of U.S. manufacturers’ market competitiveness and worsening labor-management relations, rather than being merely a negligible outlier of mainstream American liberalism. Given the absence of peak business and labor associations, these entrepreneurs designed the LMAC in a way that made it different from its European counterparts. Drawing from the literature on political entrepreneurship and creative syncretism in American political development, I describe where the tripartite experiment failed and how it paved the way toward industrial pluralism in a legal sense, and toward growth liberalism or reactionary Keynesianism in an economic sense. The article contributes to the burgeoning literature concerning various U.S. policy experiments to address problems in market coordination."
Conclusion: The Global Forces of Populism,This article locates the unique discursive contribution of women’s protests against India’s Citizen Amendment Act in 2019–2020 in the history of Muslim identity formation in South Asia. It does this by reviewing the relationship between religious reform and identity politics since colonial times and contrasts it with arguments and practices of the women involved in the protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. It contextualizes the hermeneutical arguments anchored around the idea of community and nation in colonial and postcolonial governance in South Asia. And it compares them to the women’s methods and experiences of protest that privilege a relation to blood and soil to demonstrate the significance of experience as an alternative basis for the political imagination of Muslim identity in South Asia.
"The Rise of China’s Statist Intellectuals: Law, Sovereignty, and “Repoliticization”","Contemporary democracies feature an increasingly diverse and complex variety of democratic practices. The systematic observation of these practices offers a valuable yet neglected source of insight for current debates on democratic systems and for institutional design. Taking democratic practices as the starting point for theorization counters the tendency to think that democracy has some sort of fixed core around which a political system should be organized. Drawing from literature on democratic practices in social movements and democratic innovations, I illustrate three ways to advance institutional design in the wake of the systemic turn. First, I call for greater attention to the role of political actors in institutional innovation. Second, I show how to better address issues of temporality in institutional design. Third, I introduce the concept of democratic assemblage as a means to understand and reform democracies."
The Constraining Power of the Purse: Executive Discretion and Legislative Appropriations,"As critics have recently demonstrated, developmentalist thinking sustains modern European imperialism by portraying non-Europeans as further back on a fixed scale of civilizations. The problem persists in the developmental logics underlying contemporary Marxist and liberal political theory, suggesting that developmentalism is implicitly bound to domination and imperialism. This article complicates this connection by drawing out anti-imperial developmentalist arguments articulated from the other side of the colonial divide. I elaborate three distinctive developmental logics in anti-imperialisms advanced by Surendranath Banerjea, Aurobindo Ghose, and Shyamji Krishnavarma, leading figures in India’s independence movement, to show the particularity of the form of developmentalism so intimately bound to domination. This exposition aims to provincialize it by uncovering alternative developmentalist schemas offering distinctive conceptual resources for understanding progress in relation to anti-imperialism. By reaching beyond the Western lens framing the problem of developmentalism, I show its instabilities and consider its utility in resisting imperialism."
A U.S. Tripartite Experiment in the Kennedy Administration,"In March 2016, Microsoft launched Tay.AI, a chatbot designed to experiment with conversational understanding through direct engagement with social media users. Marketed as the digital representation of an 18–24-year-old, cis-gendered female, Tay.ai was meant to be chatty, personable, friendly, and innocuous. Hours into launch, however, the chatbot’s mimetic programming structure was taken advantage of by organized groups of online social media users, and Tay.ai began replying to queries with alt-right and neo-Nazi ideology. In this article, I explore the role that Tay.ai’s assigned gender and race played in influencing both Tay.ai’s initial design and, subsequently, the program’s monstrous evolution. This is achieved through three avenues of thought. First, I situate Tay within the new public of Web 2.0, a space reliant on user participation and beholden to the neoliberal, racialized, and gendered architectures that produce it. I then consider Tay as an evolution of the chatbot, arguing that Tay is emblematic of both race and gender as social technologies. Third, I explore Tay’s aberration from programmatic protocols in the context of the monstrous and the abject, suggesting that digital nonhuman ambivalence to programming and encoded control presents a space of productive creativity."
Shaheen Bagh and the hermeneutics of Muslim identity in South Asia,"In just a few years, China has become one of the world’s largest markets for Western luxury products. Marketing professionals play a key role in this market. As symbolic brokers between the production and consumption of goods, they analyze and attempt to shape the relationship between Chinese people and foreign things. In this essay, I explore the ideas and practices of marketing professionals based in China, mainly foreign professionals, surrounding the consumption of foreign luxury goods in China. I develop the notion of “pedagogical value” to refer to the politics of value deployed in marketing activities in China today. The circulation and consumption of foreign goods in China involves power relations that challenge not only the value of things but also the authority to decide what value is and who can create value. I show that the marketing of foreign luxury in China among such professionals is transformed into a political pedagogy of value that attempts to protect the image of foreign luxury in this country as a source of power and value."
Learning from Democratic Practices: New Perspectives in Institutional Design,"1966, the inaugural year of China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was also the thirtieth anniversary of Lu Xun’s death. Quotations from and praise of China’s best known and preeminent modern writer were in abundance that year and an official commemorative event, reportedly attended by more than seventy thousand people, was held in Beijing. The anniversary date presented the Maoist state with a prime opportunity for boosting the cultural and intellectual authority of their doctrinal assertions by association with Lu Xun. In asking what Lu Xun was in 1966, I seek to bring to view the thingness of his afterlife (or afterlives) under CCP rule. This paper discusses how the Maoist treatment of Lu Xun turned him into a political icon, to add aesthetic value to Mao Zedong Thought. Insofar as aesthetics turns on what can be felt, heard, seen, sensed, touched, or imagined, aestheticization is generally accompanied by a certain process of reification. I thus consider the concrete instances by which people came to experience Lu Xun—such as selected quotations from Lu Xun, Chairman Mao’s formulations about Lu Xun, and images of the writer in poster art—focusing in particular on the widely publicized speeches presented at the official commemoration of his death in October 1966. Since the 1980s, these 1966 commemorations have been routinely disparaged in China as an aberration. To take the Maoist version of Lu Xun seriously as the careful construction of an aesthetic object is to do more than elucidate its ideological abuse of Lu Xun. By engaging productively with the Maoist craving for an ideal revolutionary comportment, we may yet catch a glimpse of the kind of world it took for Lu Xun to make sense as a Maoist icon. Without this Maoist intensity of feeling, there would not have been the post-Maoist preoccupation with recovering or defending, as it were, Lu Xun’s true or real form (if such a phenomenologically pure act is even possible)."
Provincializing Progress: Developmentalism and Anti-Imperialism in Colonial India,"Many now believe a segregated online news market has led to increased polarization in the United States. Indeed, experimental studies in political science and psychology show that partisans are more interested in reading attitude-reinforcing information. Yet, observational studies of web browsing behavior have thus far found limited differences between Democratic and Republican online news consumption. We present two new pieces of evidence showing how partisans selectively approach congenial news online. First, using a data set of web-browsing histories from the 2016 US general election (August–November 2016), we show that Democrats (Republicans) split their news consumption between left-leaning (right-leaning) sources and moderate/mainstream sources. Most partisan convergence occurs at portal sites—such as Yahoo and MSN—that specialize in nonnews and nonpolitical content. Second, using high-profile scandals from the 2016 election (Access Hollywood and the Comey letter), we show that partisans consume more news when an event benefits their preferred candidate."
"Chatbots, Gender, and Race on Web 2.0 Platforms: Tay.AI as Monstrous Femininity and Abject Whiteness","What is backlash, and how might it vary? I view misogyny and backlash as operating on a continuum. Misogyny and backlash are both organized around power that is structured through hierarchy. Backlash is concerned with impeding the exchange of power from those who “should” have it (i.e., the “natural” power holders at the top of the hierarchy) to those who “should not” (i.e., the remaining groups below). Following this, backlash is the moment of revelation. It is the point when a group’s treatment signals that a do-not-cross line has been breached. For some, the distance between everyday lived experience and the line of backlash is relatively small; for others, it may be quite significant. Finally, I argue that the backlash spectrum is best understood as multinodal. Such a conception can unpack the hierarchical organization of power as it relates to backlash, and it can capture the interaction of privilege and disadvantage within and among the different groups, especially different groups of women, that experience backlash differently."
Pedagogies of value: Marketing luxury in China,"This contribution to the symposium examines tensions holding back the development of securitization theory and proposed potential avenues to transcend and resolve them. Specifically, it argues that the evolution of securitization has been shaped by two main debates: one between those who hold that securitization is decided by the elite and those who hold that it is co-constructed by the elite and target audiences; and a second debate between scholars who treat securitization as de-politicization and researchers who argue that securitization cannot be severed from politics. While these debates have been acknowledged in the literature, they are seldom if ever addressed. This article examines the roots of these tensions, showing how they have undermined the coherence of the theory. It then introduces the concept of a regime of practices as a promising solution, arguing that it better accounts for how security issues emerge and acquire their legitimacy, which provides them with a social stickiness. Further, the article shows that both moments of creation and transformation of regimes of practices involve a specific kind of politics (the politics of the extraordinary), wherein ideas, principles, and aims of the community are said to be vitally at stake."
Lu Xun in 1966: On Valuing a Maoist Icon,"A prominent view of equality that has arisen in recent years—social or relational equality—argues that whatever the distribution of quantifiable resources in a society, citizens must treat each other as equals: if some citizens are ignored because they are seen as low-status, it is a problem that should be rectified. However, the meaning of relational equality is vague. As an exercise in “middle-range” theorizing, we operationalize several conjectures that are compatible with relational equality and submit these to empirical tests. In particular, we examine whether high-status people give little credence to the political views of low-status individuals. We find that some citizens’ political views are indeed given less credence, but that this pattern occurs not because of their status per se but, rather, because of how they communicate their arguments. Our findings help to clarify what aspects of relational equality represent the most promising avenues for further inquiry."
Discrimination,"This article analyzes a certification process undertaken by Sateré-Mawé indigenous people from the Brazilian Amazon, as part of a “global localization” strategy aimed to reappropriate a plant that is both cultivated and globalized. Through their attempt to establish that the guaraná they produce and sell is the original one, they seek to restore the plant’s central role in their social organization and epistemology, while pursuing broader goals of cultural, political, and territorial autonomy. Our analysis focuses on the knowledge politics and on the processes of translation at play in the negotiation of certification standards, in order to show how and to what extent the actors involved manage to understand each other’s ideas and practices, to negotiate shared values and goals, and to establish standards defining what is authentic. It also explores the “generative interfaces” between anthropology and law so as to produce situated ethnographies of how the global is constructed."
Partisan Enclaves and Information Bazaars: Mapping Selective Exposure to Online News,"Affective polarization—the tendency of ordinary partisans to dislike and distrust those from the other party—is a defining feature of contemporary American politics. High levels of out-party animus stem, in part, from misperceptions of the other party’s voters. Specifically, individuals misestimate the ideological extremity and political engagement of typical out-partisans. When partisans are asked about “Democrats” or the “Republican Party,” they bring to mind stereotypes of engaged ideologues and, hence, express contempt for the other party. The reality, however, is that such individuals are the exception rather than the norm. We show that when partisans learn that reality, partisan animus falls sharply; partisans do not have much animus toward the typical member of the other party. Our results suggest antidotes for vitiating affective polarization but also complicate understandings of good citizenship."
Backlash as the Moment of Revelation,"This article proposes an interpretation of the intellectual origins of neoliberalism. Influenced by scientific modernism, its founders held that knowledge, being indeterminate and uncertain, was fragile. They feared that the authority of science could be corrupted and made to serve political aims opposed to liberal values. As a result, early neoliberals endeavored to rebuild the principles of liberalism from a moral-epistemological position. They put forward a moral and legal framework that could stabilize the market economy and embed liberal values in the process of science. Later neoliberals, however, set forth a more instrumental vision of morality and knowledge that unraveled the early neoliberal project."
"Securitization Theory: Past, Present, and Future","Although there is a substantial literature on the causes and consequences of the initiation of primary elections in the United States, there is little documentation of changes in primaries after the 1920s, and most research on the subject typically argues that political parties reasserted control over the candidate nomination process through changes to primary rules. In this article, I seek to make two contributions. First, I catalog and categorize changes in primary laws between 1928 and 1970. Second, I evaluate claims about why primary laws changed. I find no evidence that there was a consistent effort to increase party control over primaries. Rather, the states that had been most likely to experiment with primaries in the early decades of the twentieth century continued to do so in later decades, and these experiments were often driven by defects in existing laws or by changes in two-party competition. However, parties did adapt primaries to their ends."
Who Gives Credence to Whom? Exploring Status and Relational Equality with Empirical Tests,"Corruption is sustained by powerful male networks, reinforcing women’s exclusion from politics. Yet, contrary to this conventional wisdom, we theorize that corruption can sometimes increase women’s access to power. Since women are often perceived as “cleaner” than men, where institutions allow heads of government to be held accountable on economic issues, chief executives may use women’s inclusion in high-profile posts to signal that they are curbing the abuse of public office for private gain. Examining upward of 150 countries over 16 years, we investigate whether and where corruption is linked to the presence of women finance ministers—a high-profile post capable of quelling economic malfeasance. We show that increases in corruption bolster women’s presence, particularly in countries with free and fair elections and presidential systems. That our results hold only in contexts of high accountability suggests this relationship is not endogenous but reflects chief executives’ efforts to preempt punishment."
Found again in translation? Standardizing the authenticity of guaraná among the Sateré-Mawé people (Brazilian Amazon),"This essay traces documentary cinema’s entanglement in material productions in industry, agriculture, and infrastructure during China’s Great Leap Forward (1957–1961) and uses documentary as a prism to investigate the intertwined histories of media practice and social transformation. I argue that as the fastest growing mode of filmmaking, documentary inculcated a complex temporal aesthetic in this period and propelled the Great Leap Forward as a productive force. Taylorist images provided sensorial training for a rapidly expanding labor force, instilling in new workers the rhythm and speed of optimal industrial movement. Meanwhile, a new mode of artistic documentary blurred the distinction between documentary and fiction, with a practice of documenting tomorrow that shunned uncertainty and brought the future into palpable proximity. Rapidly made to approximate the simultaneous time of television, but delivered manually by mobile projectionists to sites of mass labor all over the country, documentary films accompanied sleepless mass labor on a 24/7 schedule and played pivotal roles in disseminating age-old vernacular technologies, such as the backyard furnaces, to grave consequences. What was the Chinese revolution? How do we grasp its energies and entropies, and account for its failures? Understanding documentary as a critical media that articulated and supported the radical temporality and epistemology of the Great Leap Forward, this essay argues for the important role of media and mediation in delimiting the epistemological, political, and aesthetic possibilities that shaped the paths of the revolution’s actualization."
(Mis)estimating Affective Polarization,"Ordinarily, campaign strategies are designed solely to win elections. We argue that the partisan strategies of 2020 should take account of the prospect of defeat, because the way parties lose can have as much significance as what they can accomplish when they win. This election is extraordinary because Trump’s presidency is not merely disruptive but also destabilizing; it stresses and perhaps threatens democratic institutions such as political parties as well as foundational democratic practices such as the peaceful turnover of power after an incumbent’s defeat. For these reasons, partisans of both parties should look beyond the short-term strategies of the election season to the public philosophies that endure through victory or defeat, and that vie to define the soul not only of the parties but of the constitutional order itself."
"Fragile Knowledge, Moral Pitfalls: Early Neoliberalism and Its Demise","This article describes Brazil’s late twentieth-century religious transformation through the lens of an Amazonian settler family whom I call the Solanhas. Accounts of various Solanha members’ shifting religious and political commitments elucidate how the perceived impossibility of constant human (as opposed to divine) friendship, a perception that also applies to the limitations of kinship, is implicated in the move from an encompassing Catholicism to an intensifying secularity. In foregrounding problems of friendship and kinship, the ethnography begins from a different premise than most studies of secularity. Anthropologists have tended to describe secularity as a condition secured by political/state secularism, which manages and produces distinctions between religion and politics. Drawing on the work of Marilyn Strathern and others, I show that relations, especially kinship and friendship, are more vital than secularism in animating distinctions among religion(s) and politics. I argue that if secularity is to be grasped more fully, the flow of all conceptual and interpersonal relations, and especially kinship and friendship in all their instability, must be brought into view. An anthropologically informed approach to secularity, and ultimately to history, should emphasize the irresolvable challenges of relating, as these challenges will remain key elements of life, knowledge, and ultimately of change in these mutable times."
"Retrenchment or Reform? Changes in Primary Election Laws, 1928–70","Scholars have argued that becoming a parent affects political behavior, including turnout. In this article, we identify the effect on turnout of having an additional child conditional on the decision to become a parent. When parents have a child, nature sometimes assigns additional children through twinning. We argue that conditional on age of parents and birth cohort this as-if randomly assigns an extra child to some parents. With a large data set of family composition and validated turnout for Danish voters, we find, consistent with additional children taking up parents’ time and indirectly increasing the cost of voting, that having an additional child at the same time as another depresses turnout for both parents. Mothers who had twins in their first parity are 1.6 to 3.0 percentage points less likely to vote across three elections. For fathers, turnout is only depressed by 0.7 to 1.4 percentage points."
"Corruption, Accountability, and Women’s Access to Power","Political theorists have long worried that propaganda turns the democratic commitment to open communication into a tool of domination by elites. Where recent empirical and normative work on elite rhetoric focuses on how speech acts can exercise democratically problematic forms of power, I draw on John Dewey to argue that such approaches neglect how social organization shapes audiences’ vulnerability to propaganda. I reconstruct Dewey’s account of how social fragmentation and inequality impede cross-group communication, creating structural flaws in collective inquiry that propaganda in turn exploits. Dewey suggests that decoupling analysis of propagandic speech acts from the context of their reception fails to fully capture the harm done to democratic publics. His positive account provides new grounding for studying how social institutions and social inequality mediate the effect of elite rhetoric on democratic practice."
Do Politicians Discriminate Against Constituents with an Immigration Background? Field Experimental Evidence from Germany,"Many theorize that public opinion follows political elite on climate change skepticism, yet evidence of a causal link is lacking. I use a regression discontinuity design to establish the impact of the political party of a governor on constituents’ global warming beliefs. I find that, relative to the election of a Democratic governor, the election of a Republican governor significantly decreases the probability of a Republican constituent believing in global warming by approximately 11–15 percentage points; there is no significant impact on Democratic constituents. I also find a negative effect of a Republican governor on belief in human-caused global warming that does not differ by constituent partisan affiliation. These results provide one explanation for the increased political polarization in global warming beliefs despite the scientific consensus. Belief formation often plays an important role in political economy models, so these findings also have implications for implementing climate change policy."
When Taylorism Met Revolutionary Romanticism: Documentary Cinema in China’s Great Leap Forward,"Primary elections are increasingly popular around the world, but historically political parties have typically chosen their candidate selection mechanisms in a decentralized manner. We develop a theory that accounts for variation in the use of primary elections in these settings. In our model, two parties choose candidates for general elections over an infinite horizon. Each party has an elite and a nonelite faction, where the elite faction can choose whether to hold primaries or nominate itself. Primaries produce more electable candidates, but losing a primary also deprives elites of private goods and future elite status. The model predicts that parties adopt primaries under high ideological polarization or when they are electorally disadvantaged. Additionally, we show how rigidities in the ability of winners to change candidate selection mechanisms can increase the universal adoption of primaries in electorally volatile environments."
Will the Election of 2020 Prove To Be the End or a New Beginning?,"A great challenge for capitalist development under authoritarian regimes is to effectively constrain predatory behavior. Beyond existing frameworks of the dictator’s time horizon and institutionalized power sharing, we introduce an alternative perspective—elite cleavage. We argue that the systematic vulnerability of marginalized local cadres motivated them to ally with grassroots constituents and protect local economic interests in order to increase the odds of political survival. Difference-in-differences analysis of counties in two Chinese provinces shows that the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution created a moment of political decentralization which enabled marginalized local elites to protect local entrepreneurs against national-level radical policies, resulting in much more vibrant private economic activities in some regions. Further empirical evidence shows that elite cleavages formed in the 1940s had a long-lasting impact on economic performance in the reform era."
"The Work of Impossibility in Brazil: Friendship, Kinship, Secularity","The American pro-life movement’s “mother-child strategy,” which emphasizes the alignment of fetal and maternal interests, complicates conceptions of backlash. Pro-life activists claim that it is now feminists who are engaging in backlash against the movement for “fetal human rights.” Although this claim does reflect the troublingly defensive position in which advocates of reproductive freedom currently find themselves, I contend that neither pro-life nor pro-choice activism can be adequately captured by the notion of backlash. I also argue that pro-life discourse has evolved from a backlash into a neopatriarchal campaign for a future that superficially reconfigures but ultimately deepens reproductive oppression. Because the pro-life movement has a complicated relationship with neoliberal feminism, I conclude that feminists should respond by developing new discourses about pregnant bodies and visions of a feminist future that offer an alternative to neoliberalism."
Twice the Trouble: Twinning and the Cost of Voting,"Do voters have stable immigration views? While any account of immigration politics must make an assumption about whether underlying attitudes are stable, the literature has been ambiguous regarding the issue. To remedy this omission, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the stability and change of immigration attitudes. Theoretically, we develop a framework to explicate the temporal assumptions in previous research and find that most studies assume attitudes are flexible. Empirically, we draw on nine panel data sets to test the stability question and use multiple approaches to account for measurement error. We find that immigration attitudes are remarkably stable over time and robust to major economic and political shocks. Overall, these findings provide more support for theories emphasizing socialization and stable predispositions rather than information or environmental factors. Consequently, scholars should exercise caution in using changing context to explain immigration attitudes or in using immigration attitudes to explain political change."
"“The Greatest Flood of Mass Suggestion”: John Dewey, Propaganda, and Epistemic Costs of Social Organization","Why do the rich and poor support different parties in some places? We argue that voting along class lines is more likely to occur where states can tax the income and assets of the wealthy. In low bureaucratic capacity states, the rich are less likely to participate in electoral politics because they have less to fear from redistributive policy. When wealthy citizens abstain from voting, politicians face a more impoverished electorate. Because politicians cannot credibly campaign on antitax platforms, they are less likely to emphasize redistribution and partisan preferences are less likely to diverge across income groups. Using cross-national survey data, we show that there is more class voting in countries with greater bureaucratic capacity. We also show that class voting and fiscal capacity were correlated in the United States in the mid-1930s when state-level revenue collection and party systems were less dependent on national economic policy."
Elite Influence on Climate Change Skepticism: Evidence from Close Gubernatorial Elections,"Do local elections under autocracy help the poor? We argue that local appointees in electoral authoritarian regimes have political incentives that undermine public service provision; regime leaders’ preoccupation with national electoral control encourages them to overlook local governance problems if subnational officials can still deliver requisite votes in national elections. Using geographic and temporal variation across Russian cities (2002–12) in the elimination of mayoral elections, we investigate how mayoral appointments affect the maintenance of aging housing infrastructure. We find that, compared to elected mayors, appointed mayors allow more of their Soviet-era housing stock to become dilapidated and unsafe. Moreover, bad housing increases more in cities where appointees deliver high vote shares to the ruling party in national elections. Thus, while local elections under authoritarianism can improve local governance, the holding of semi-competitive national elections can actually undermine incentives for local appointees to provide public services."
"Shaping Science: Organizations, Decisions, and Culture on NASA’s Teams by Janet Vertesi","Research on the effects of racial context on public opinion often use residence-based measures of context, ignoring how the demographic composition of a context may change throughout the day. In this short article, we introduce a new zip code–level measure, racial flux, that accounts for how contexts differ between worker and resident populations. We merge our measure with survey data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and show that greater racial flux—more Black workers relative to Black residents in a zip code—is associated with more conservative voting behaviors and racial attitudes among whites who live in the zip code. Our study suggests that whites are as politically responsive to the presence of nonresident minorities as they are resident minorities. More work is needed on measuring racial context and on exploring the contours of how and why context affects political preferences."
A Dynamic Model of Primaries,"This article examines the shifting status of women in rural Bhutan, some of whom, while living in a social arrangement characterized by matrilineal inheritance and matrilocal residence, can become seemingly marginalized in old age. It analyzes the occupancy trajectories of women against the backdrop of aging, the loss of power, and the traditional land tenure system, considering their linkages to the transformation of one’s home from a secure and inclusive to an insecure and disorienting place. Landlessness or “houselessness” is provoked not just by capitalist relations; the potential for marginality in old age is also embedded in the gendered structures of inheritance. The elders living on porches nevertheless view their dwellings as socially secure even as they experience sociospatial marginality and alienation not only from the larger community but also from their own families. This divergent view of their situation is intertwined with the Buddhist notion of karma."
Elite Cleavage and the Rise of Capitalism under Authoritarianism: A Tale of Two Provinces in China,"Existing research shows that participation rates are higher in competitive electoral contexts. However, it is difficult to disentangle whether this contextual effect is a function of geographic heterogeneity or the strategic incentives for participation that individuals face in close elections. In this article, we partially circumvent this dilemma by focusing on out-of-state college students facing the choice of where to cast their vote. Using a novel survey and administrative records for over 1 million out-of-state students, we show that individuals attending college in a state where the election is more competitive than in their home state are more likely to register in their campus state, consistent with theories of strategic behavior. We argue that by focusing on this population and this question we are better able to assess the relationship between strategic incentives and political behavior while holding constant state-specific context."
"Whose Backlash, against Whom? Feminism and the American Pro-Life Movement’s “Mother-Child Strategy”","Communities provide a crucial experiential context for native-immigrant interactions, yet we know little about the impact of local government performance on shaping public responses to immigrants. Building on arguments considering efficient governments as critical factors in facilitating immigrant integration and mitigating denizens' political deprivation, we argue that efficient local governments also play a significant role in reducing anti-immigrant behavior. Using cost efficiency modeling to generate a measure of local government efficiency (LGE), we show high LGE is associated with fewer incidents of anti-immigrant violence in Germany during its unprecedented refugee intake in 2015. Testing the broader implications of our theory, we employ longitudinal data on LGE of Dutch municipalities merged with police records of criminal offenses against immigrants (2012–15). Results from two-way fixed effects models show a systematic, negative link between efficiency and violence. Our results suggest that improving local governance can have salutary benefits on intergroup relations."
The Stability of Immigration Attitudes: Evidence and Implications,"I consider a model of political agency in which an incumbent politician makes two decisions in sequence, having private information about the correct decision in each period. I find that policy reversals signal that a politician is incompetent. This suggests that the stigma associated with flip-flopping can be rationalized as a simple heuristic to select competent politicians. Furthermore, the negative impact of policy reversals on reputation gives the incumbent politician an incentive to disregard new information and stick to his initial policy. When reputation concerns are sufficiently strong, these incentives inhibit policy responsiveness, resulting in an inefficient degree of policy persistence. Term-limited politicians, or politicians with particularly safe (or compromised) election prospects, are more likely to reverse decisions. Relatedly, politicians are only willing to reverse decisions after a sufficient amount of time has passed or when there is sufficient evidence that the state of the world might have changed."
Bureaucratic Capacity and Class Voting: Evidence from across the World and the United States,"Thomas Hobbes’s political philosophy occupies a central place within civil war research and has inspired a prominent approach to conflict onset focused on sovereign authority’s breakdown. Yet this work rarely draws on Hobbes as an analyst of the English Civil War (1642–1651), chronicled in Behemoth (1681). What does this more historical work show about the causes of civil war? How does it compare to the theoretical insights conflict scholars derive from Hobbes’s philosophy? We rethink Hobbes’s thought within conflict research, arguing that his account of the English Civil War provides a complex causal process in which ideas and meanings bridge the disjuncture between elite and mass actors: top-down ideological overtures reshape the material foundations of individuals’ incentives to rebel. At the same time, mass actors interpret and render meaningful these claims based on existing beliefs and predispositions, spurring emotional responses conducive to taking up arms. These insights highlight the need to re-examine conventional analytical categories in studies of civil war and deploy temporally sensitive strategies for explaining conflict evolution."
Do Authoritarian Elections Help the Poor? Evidence from Russian Cities,"Peace processes can bring to the fore a host of normative and practical questions that produce heated public disagreement. These disagreements can generate political obstacles to the successful negotiation and implementation of settlements. Here, I argue that public dissatisfaction with peace processes is in part rooted in core, fundamental differences in worldview, which have been found to inform how citizens form preferences over a wide array of security-related policy issues. Drawing on an original survey fielded at the height of the Colombian peace process, I show that the core values that guide people’s everyday lives have implications for how they think about and behave during peace processes. Results from a conjoint experiment indicate that individuals with more fixed, or “authoritarian,” worldviews hold strong preferences for more punitive agreements than individuals who score low on these qualities. These same individuals were also more likely than their counterparts to abstain from the 2016 peace referendum, although surprisingly not more likely to vote against than in favor. The study sheds light on the microfoundations of public barriers to conflict termination and suggests that core, fundamental differences underlie public discord on the merits of conflict negotiations."
Black Workers in White Places: Daytime Racial Diversity and White Public Opinion,"Political surveys often include multi-item scales to measure individual predispositions such as authoritarianism, egalitarianism, or racial resentment. Scholars use these scales to examine group differences in these predispositions, comparing women to men, rich to poor, or Republicans to Democrats. Such research implicitly assumes that, say, Republicans’ and Democrats’ responses to the egalitarianism scale measure the same construct in the same metric. This research rarely evaluates whether the data possess the characteristics necessary to justify this equivalence assumption. We present a framework to test this assumption and correct scales when it fails to hold. Examining 13 commonly used scales on the 2012 and 2016 American National Elections Studies, we find widespread violations of the equivalence assumption. These violations often bias the estimated magnitude or direction of theoretically important group differences. These results suggest we must reevaluate what we think we know about the causes and consequences of authoritarianism, egalitarianism, and other predispositions."
"Life on the Porch: Marginality, Women, and Old Age in Rural Bhutan","A source of national shame can be the perception that one’s nation is intellectually inferior to other nations. This kind of national shame can lead not to despair but to a sense of national responsibility to engage in creative self-renewal and to create national identity from scratch. An exemplar of someone who recognized and engaged with this kind of national shame is Nguyễn An Ninh (1900–1943), an influential Vietnamese anti-colonial intellectual in French colonial Vietnam. Ninh’s account of national shame challenges existing assumptions in political theory, namely that national identity requires national pride, that national shame comes from bad actions towards outside groups, and that national responsibility means responsibility for those bad actions. Postcolonial and decolonial literature have tended to attribute any perception of inferiority on the part of the colonized to “internalized inferiority,” and to assume the existence of an indigenous “original” culture that colonizers destroy, overlooking the fact that natives themselves sometimes questioned the existence of “original” culture. Ninh shows that colonized people can be ashamed of lacking intellectual culture on their own terms and be anti-colonial at the same time."
Closeness and Strategic Participation: Does the Relative Closeness of the US Presidential Elections Shape Where College Students Register to Vote?,"While elite polarization in US politics has been well established, there has been substantial debate about whether US mass opinion has polarized in recent decades. Amnon Cavari and Guy Freedman suggest the apparent polarization of the US public may in part be an artifact of declining survey response rates. Cavari and Freedman argue that declining response rates may have led to only the most politicized—and therefore polarized—respondents being willing to give their opinions. We argue that, while the mechanism posited is plausible, other theoretical models of nonresponse predict no change in nonresponse bias or even declining nonresponse bias, depending on the cause of increased nonresponse. We show that the results of Cavari and Freedman’s analysis are spuriously driven by each variable’s correlation with time. After accounting for the time correlation, there is no evidence that nonresponse bias has inflated estimates of mass polarization."
Local Government Efficiency and Anti-immigrant Violence,"Ever since the debate between ideal and nonideal theory emerged in political theory, a “strong position” has been defended, which holds that ideal theory is useless for theorizing what ought to be done to make our actual societies more just. Varieties of this position have been put forward, but the criticism has been underdeveloped. In the last couple of years, however, the strong position has been defended in a more systematic way and on other grounds than previous proposals. It is argued that ideal theory is entirely uninformative for theorizing nonideal principles. It is this version of the strong position that is scrutinized in the present paper. We make two claims. First, we argue that the arguments put forward fail to demonstrate that ideal theory is uninformative in the intended sense. Second, we sketch plausible ways in which ideal theory may be informative in construing principles for our current conditions."
Flip-Flopping and Electoral Concerns,"Recent studies provide conflicting accounts of whether indirect contact with the American carceral state mobilizes. We revisit this controversy, using a large national survey of Black Americans that includes a novel measure of social connections to people with felony convictions to examine spillover dynamics. We find that while ties to the carceral state are widespread, the impact of these connections on participation is moderated by the severity of state-level felony disenfranchisement laws. In states with the most severe disenfranchisement policies, close ties to people with felony convictions increase both voting and nonvoting participation, but there is no effect in states with more moderate laws. The findings suggest that surrogate participation may be at work, whereby formally removing the rights of one group in a way that seems extreme or unjust mobilizes those close to them, and highlight the importance of policy context on political behavior."
“To Make Men Believe Their Rebellion Just”: Thomas Hobbes and the Study of Civil War,"Candidate choice survey experiments in the form of conjoint or vignette experiments have become a standard part of the political science toolkit for understanding the effects of candidate characteristics on vote choice. We collect 67 such studies from all over the world and reanalyze them using a standardized approach. We find that the average effect of being a woman (relative to a man) is a gain of approximately 2 percentage points. We find some evidence of heterogeneity across contexts, candidates, and respondents. The difference is somewhat larger for white (vs. black) candidates and among survey respondents who are women (vs. men) or, in the US context, identify as Democrats or Independents (vs. Republicans). Our results add to the growing body of experimental and observational evidence that voter preferences are not a major factor explaining the persistently low rates of women in elected office."
Peace without Impunity: Worldview in the Settlement of Civil Wars,"Near the end of her career, Judith Shklar sought to redeem American political thought from the “liberal consensus,” which obscured the pervasive presence of both antiliberal tendencies and democratic influences that decisively shaped American political institutions and thought. In what follows, I examine these tensions and elucidate an agonistic version of liberal democracy by exploring Shklar’s account of the American founding that appears in her late work. Shklar presents American political development as a contentious but creative interplay among liberal constitutionalism, democratic egalitarianism, and a politics of justice, while at the same time acknowledging their complicity with the antiliberal social and racial hierarchies. I conclude with a discussion of Shklar’s defense of liberal constitutionalism, which does not displace politics as some radical democrats and civic republicans insist; rather, it serves as a necessary condition that sustains democratic political conflict and offers possibilities for development."
ANES Scales Often Do Not Measure What You Think They Measure,"Future visions energize growing enterprises, states, and families to act. Together, these entwined processes and their conflicts open unpredictable avenues for both profit-making and social transformation. This was a key insight of Aihwa Ong’s classic ethnography Spirits of resistance, which was published more than thirty years ago. In Spirits, Ong developed a feminist approach to political economy that begins with this dynamic. Today, anthropological studies place the category of the future at the heart of the discipline but have neglected family aspiration and experimentation as critical forces. Returning to Ong’s focus on relationships between parents and children is necessary to deepen insights about contemporary capitalism and to revitalize political economy."
Nguyễn An Ninh’s Anti-Colonial Thought: A New Account of National Shame,"Federal civil servants need policy expertise to formulate and implement public policy. Presidents and congresses do not confer such expertise when they delegate responsibility for policy making. Existing research suggests that elected officials’ efforts to gain control of federal agencies can reduce agency expertise by inducing civil servants to exit the agency and reducing incentives for civil servants to exert effort, including acquiring policy expertise. I use data from an original survey of federal executives to examine whether politicization reduces agency expertise. I find that civil servants whose policy preferences diverge from those of political appointees are more likely to perceive that their agency is politicized and that civil servants who perceive their agency is politicized are more likely to exit the agency and less likely to engage in behaviors that build policy expertise. In total, these findings provide systematic, microlevel evidence demonstrating how politicization can reduce agency policy expertise."
Digging in the Zones of Violence (Biner's States of Dispossession: Violence and Precarious Coexistence in Southeast Turkey),"John Locke presents self-defense in a way similar to American Stand Your Ground laws: lethal retribution in the name of individual freedom. Interrogating a common law distinction—justifiable versus excusable homicide—highlights how Locke supports both (1) a law of nature grounded in individual freedom and achieved through individual judgment and action (justifiable homicide) and (2) a rule of law founded on collective freedom and equality and actualized through external law enforcement and procedures removed from individual control (excusable homicide). Although Locke’s radical version of justified homicide insufficiently considers how bias and self-interest distort judgment and undercut the rule of law, excusable homicide’s requirement of retreat might ameliorate several effects of bias. This analysis of lethal self-defense improves our understanding of Locke’s political thought and provides a lens for assessing current controversies over Stand Your Ground that have consequences for liberal government."
Correlation with Time Explains the Relationship between Survey Nonresponse and Mass Polarization,"How and why does protest shape participants’ attitudes? We study this issue using panel data gathered both before and after Ukraine’s Euromaidan protests. We argue that frames play a key role in this process. We find that protest participation increased alignment of protesters’ policy preferences with the main protest frames by stabilizing existing attitudes that were in alignment and changing attitudes that conflicted with the dominant frame. Attitudes on core protest issues also became more coherent. We find no comparable effects for issues less central to the protests, and all effects vary as the framing and protest environment changed. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of attitude change, showing that while protesters also experience significant increases in efficacy, interest, and participation, these changes only partly explain attitudinal changes. These findings speak to both the short- and long-term mechanisms by which protest participation can shape public opinion."
Is Ideal Theory Useless for Nonideal Theory?,"Growing evidence suggests that pocketbook considerations influence voting behavior in the United States and other developed countries and that incumbents can use targeted government benefits to win voter support. It remains unclear whether the general relationship between government spending and incumbent support also holds for means-tested welfare programs, however. I contribute to this empirical literature by taking advantage of the decade-long rollout of the American Food Stamp Program. The staggered timing of local program implementation allows me to credibly estimate the causal effect of this new benefit on election outcomes. Overall, I find that Democrats—at the center of the program’s enacting coalition—gained votes when the program was implemented locally, apparently through mobilization of new supporters rather than the conversion of political opponents."
Do Felony Disenfranchisement Laws (De)Mobilize? A Case of Surrogate Participation,"Populist discourse is conceptually antiestablishment. Extensive research has found that political dissatisfaction is associated with populist support. However, most tests have been in cases with populist parties in opposition. This essay asks what happens to antiestablishment populist supporters once their candidate wins a national election. I argue, based on cognitive dissonance theory, that these supporters change their view of which actors constitute the political establishment so that their leader is not part of it. The hypothesis is tested with survey data from Bolivia and Ecuador collected when two populist presidents (Evo Morales and Rafael Correa) were elected. Results confirm that populist supporters dissociate the federal government from other political institutions once a populist is elected president, and that this dissociation can last for a few years. This has theoretical implications for understanding how individuals continue to support antiestablishment governments, important in a time of populist victories in several countries."
What Have We Learned about Gender from Candidate Choice Experiments? A Meta-Analysis of Sixty-Seven Factorial Survey Experiments,"Political checks on democratic backsliding can be ineffective. But, there may be economic costs for backsliding regimes if talented individuals seeking job opportunities prefer to not live in backsliding areas. Of course, factors other than the quality of democracy may be more important to job seekers, limiting the efficacy of this economic check. We test these possibilities in an area characterized as experiencing backsliding—the US states—using a conjoint experiment. We provide hypothetical job opportunities to a sample of US adults in the labor market and another sample of students at a large, selective public university. We find that jobs located in states experiencing democratic backsliding are viewed less favorably. Moreover, some types of backsliding affect willingness to accept a hypothetical job, especially among Democrats in the nonstudent sample."
“Our End Was in Our Beginning”: Judith Shklar and the American Founding,"Does the way we speak affect what we think about gender equality? Languages vary by how much they require speakers to attend to gender. Genderless tongues (e.g., Estonian) do not oblige speakers to designate the gender of objects, while gendered tongues do (e.g., Russian). By neglecting to distinguish between male and female objects, we hypothesize that speakers of genderless tongues will express more liberalized attitudes toward gender equality. Using an experiment that assigned the interview language to 1,200 Estonian/Russian bilinguals, we find support for this proposition. In a second experiment, we replicate this result and demonstrate its absence for attitudes without obvious gender referents. We also provide some evidence suggesting that language effects weaken when social norms about acceptable behavior are made salient. Finally, we extend our principal finding through a cross-national analysis of survey data. Our results imply that language may have significant consequences for mass opinion about gender equality."
The future is family,"In this article we develop a new theory that interest group donation behavior will vary based on the politicization of industries that a particular group works in. With this theory, we develop a new empirical measure of industry politicization using mentions of contributor industry and partisan keywords in newspapers in the United States from 1999 to 2014. We show using a difference-in-differences model that as industry politicization increases, the likelihood of a political action committee (PAC) using an access-oriented donation strategy decreases and the likelihood of a PAC using an ideologically oriented donation strategy increases. Our results indicate that there is significant variation across interest groups that is often ignored when considering PACs’ donation strategies as parts of broad subgroups. Furthermore, these results illuminate the policy areas in which interest groups seek access to the legislative process via strategically placed campaign contributions."
"Politicization and Expertise: Exit, Effort, and Investment","Under what conditions do means-tested programs increase beneficiaries’ political participation? Recent scholarship has begun to shed light on this question through a series of causal studies of Medicaid expansion. This article builds on those analyses by exploring an additional case, the US expansion of Old-Age Assistance (OAA) programs between 1932 and 1940. It provides new evidence that means-tested programs can mobilize their beneficiaries and also sheds light on how these effects emerge. Exploiting state-by-state variation in expansion, I find that increases in OAA generosity increased turnout in elderly counties but increases in the OAA coverage rate did not. These findings show that resource effects are crucial to generating positive feedback and can do so even in the case of a highly stigmatizing, means-tested program. I further find that by mobilizing elderly Republican recipients, OAA cost FDR votes in Republican-leaning counties, suggesting that even positive participatory effects may undermine social programs’ entrenchment."
Retreat from the Rule of Law: Locke and the Perils of Stand Your Ground,"This contribution reflects on Aihwa Ong’s thoughts on the global and her later work with Asian scientists to look at recent Chinese state approaches to climate change. Departing from popular accounts that pose China as either an engine of climate catastrophe or as a singular hope for its aversion, I argue that the planetary predicament that climate change raises has been taken up in Chinese politics as a strategic site to reimagine the Chinese Communist Party as a necessary component of the geopolitical and geophysical machinery of continued planetary existence. Rather than gathering difference into the universal scale that the planet has implied in environmentalist discourses, Ong’s work exhorts us to approach the strategic deployment of a Chinese mode of planetarity."
Protest Participation and Attitude Change: Evidence from Ukraine’s Euromaidan Revolution,"This article studies candidate selection by party leaders and asks whether poor information about public preferences can lead elite choices to diverge from mass opinion. Working with a political party in Nepal, we show that while elites value voter preferences, these preferences only explain one-third of elite candidate selection. Next, we embed an experiment in actual candidate selection deliberations for this party and find that party leaders not only select different candidates when polling data are presented to them, but that their updated decisions also improve the party’s vote share. By opening the black box of candidate selection, this article demonstrates that closing the information gap between elites and voters has the power to improve the quality of representation."
Do Welfare Benefits Pay Electoral Dividends? Evidence from the National Food Stamp Program Rollout,"We examine the effects of national voter registration policies on voting and registration patterns with a large-scale experimental study. Together with Kenya’s electoral commission, we designed an experiment in which 1,674 communities were randomized to a status quo or treatment group, receiving civic education on voter registration, short message service reminders about registration opportunities, and/or local registration visits by election commission staff. We find little evidence that civic education improves registration. Local registration visits improve voter registration, a relationship that increases in poorer communities. Moreover, local registration increased electoral competition and vote preference diversity in down-ballot contests in the 2017 Kenyan elections. Our results suggest that status quo voter registration policies constrain political participation and competition, and that inexpensive policy changes may attenuate the effects of such constraints."
“He’s Not One of Them!” Antiestablishment Supporters of Populist Governments in Bolivia and Ecuador,"How does state surveillance influence citizens’ willingness to express political and social opinions? This article theorizes about different citizen responses to surveillance that fall on what we term the evasion-deception spectrum, including preference falsification, self-censorship, and opting out. We present the results from an empirical exploration of these responses, drawing on an online survey experiment conducted in Japan. In our survey, we use a novel experimental stimulus to assess whether individuals engage in different forms of evasion and deception when plausibly under government surveillance. The study finds that citizens are substantially more likely to opt out of sharing their opinions (by exiting a survey) when reminded of their government’s capacity for monitoring. This occurs even despite implying a monetary cost (forfeiting payment for the survey) and in a fully consolidated democracy, where freedoms of speech and opinion are legally codified. We conclude by discussing the implications of this finding for democratic deliberation and citizen-state relations."
"David Alan Parnell, Justinian’s Men: Careers and Relationships of Byzantine Army Officers, 518–610","Voting is a central pillar of political science research; indeed, scholars have long addressed questions like, “Who votes?,” “Why do people vote?,” and “What interventions increase voting?” However, only a few have considered whether voting changes adjacent civic dispositions and behaviors. In this paper, we explore the effects of voting shocks on young citizens’ political interest, memberships, social awareness, and political knowledge in the lead up to the voting experience (“upstream”) and in the months and years after (“downstream”). To do so, we use a unique combination of large survey data from two countries paired with an exact date-of-birth regression discontinuity design. We find that eligibility to vote voluntarily and exposure to compulsory voting—despite eliciting large turnout increases—have precisely estimated null effects on young people’s upstream or downstream civic engagement. While voting may be an important experience, it appears to have smaller transformative effects than previously thought."
The Economic Costs of Democratic Backsliding? Backsliding and State Location Preferences of US Job Seekers,"Increasing evidence indicates the importance of management in determining firms' productivity. Yet causal evidence regarding the effectiveness of management practices is scarce, especially for skilled labor in the developed world. In a field experiment measuring commercial airline captains’ productivity, we test four distinct management practices: performance monitoring, performance feedback, target setting, and prosocial incentives. These practices—particularly monitoring and target setting—significantly increase captains' productivity on the targeted fuel-saving dimensions, with positive spillovers on job satisfaction and CO2 emissions. The study reveals an uncharted research opportunity to delve into the black box of firms to examine the determinants of productivity among skilled labor."
Language Influences Public Attitudes toward Gender Equality,"Actor-network theory can revitalize securitization theory by refocusing on the creation of connections between issues, publics, and threats. Actor-network theory demonstrates the role that nonhuman actants play in securitization processes in order to avoid prejudging power relations and oversimplifying complex political processes. A radical approach that refigures the notions of agency and politics can reconnect securitization theory to its initial political and policy promise."
Industry Politicization and Interest Group Campaign Contribution Strategies,"Democracy is a notoriously ambiguous concept. Political scientists typically see this ambiguity as a problem that restricts measurement and causal explanation, especially for the comparative study of democratization. Increasingly ambitious data collection efforts and sophisticated methodological approaches attempt to resolve this problem—nowhere more so than in the recent, award-winning, and highly prominent Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset. By contrast, ambiguity and contestation over what democracy actually means is key both to normative theorizing and to the capacity to re-examine and reimagine democratic practice during moments of crisis. Rather than attempting to pin down and measure democratic quality, we highlight instead the value of ambiguity to normative democratic theory and interpretive political science. We offer four reflections on V-Dem based on examples from the literature on deliberative democracy, which is the discipline’s most prominent attempt to reinvent and reinvigorate democratic practice amid crisis and disaffection. Our aim is not to reignite the paradigm wars or fundamentally question the validity of projects like V-Dem, but rather to illustrate how a more plural approach might augment their theoretical and empirical contribution. We conclude by offering concrete illustrations of what this might look like in practice."
"The Electoral Effects of Social Policy: Expanding Old-Age Assistance, 1932–1940","This article rethinks the politics of fear through the researcher’s ethnography in Hong Kong. Fear is often explored as a tool of manipulation that disempowers people. In contrast, the bodies, subjectivities, and actions of the fearful people are rarely examined. This article discusses Hong Kong society’s fear through the lens of anthropological and cultural studies of affect, especially through the concept of “raw fear” proposed by David Parkin. It also investigates how fear emerges in everyday life through the researcher’s self-reflections and his conversations with other people."
Asia as strategy: Deployments of a Chinese planet,"A recent literature emphasizes political economy factors behind the wave of administrative splits across the developing world. While previous studies have focused on why some groups are more likely to obtain new administrative units, they do not explain why vote-maximizing incumbents use this arguably less efficient policy in the first place. We contribute to this literature by embedding administrative splits within incumbents’ broader electoral strategy of distributive policies. We develop a model in which incumbents target local public goods to groups for whom this is a credible signal of commitment, namely, those with a history of reciprocal relationship. When incumbents face increased electoral competition, however, other groups require a stronger signal, which is emitted by the costly creation of new units that reduces the cost of future transfers to those groups. We test our theory using electoral and public goods data from Senegal and find robust support for its predictions."
"Information, Candidate Selection, and the Quality of Representation: Evidence from Nepal","What is the link between changing economic and social circumstances and the rise of populism in Western Europe? And what does the rise of populism tell us about the political economy of mobilization at a time when party systems are changing before our eyes? A political economy approach to populism must be attentive to the long-term changes in politics and society that help to explain: what kinds of people are mobilized by what kinds of parties; the changing role of place in fostering political mobilization; the new networks of mobilization that underlie populist success; trajectories and pathways of mobilization; and the effects of the eclipse of class by risk, inequality, and austerity as mobilizing experiences."
Electoral Administration in Fledgling Democracies: Experimental Evidence from Kenya,"How much does self-interest drive Americans’ policy attitudes? Survey research typically finds that self-interest’s role is minimal. Such conclusions are typically reached by examining attitudes toward federal policies that present diffuse costs and low stakes. We consider a starker test case of self-interest: controversies surrounding development of dense and affordable housing in Americans’ communities. Liberal homeowners, especially, must cope with dissonance between their egalitarian ideology and a desire to protect their home values and quality of life. They often embrace liberal housing goals and redistributive housing policies but join conservatives in opposing dense housing in their own communities. Two survey experiments show that liberal homeowners are cross-pressured and barely more likely than conservative homeowners to support dense housing development. Messages appealing to homeowners’ self-interest reduce support further, while countervailing appeals about housing’s benefits to low- and middle-income families barely offset the negative effect. We discuss implications for the politics of equal opportunity at the state and local level."
Evade and Deceive? Citizen Responses to Surveillance,"The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 consolidated executive budgetary powers within the presidency and Congress. I evaluate how the Act reforms altered the nature of executive budgetary influence, using an original historical database from fiscal years 1895 to 1940. I show that these reforms were not only consistent with both political branches’ objective to empower presidents to rein in profligate executive budget proposals under the decentralized budgetary system but also afforded presidents greater budgetary influence when seeking higher funding levels relative to Congress. This mutually beneficial power-sharing arrangement between the president and Congress stands in contrast with existing accounts that these reforms favored one branch at the expense of the other. Finally, I offer evidence that this arrangement was made possible by solving collective action problems within the executive branch that reduced the capacity of seasoned agency heads to shape budgetary outcomes during the postreform era."
Does Voting Have Upstream and Downstream Consequences? Regression Discontinuity Tests of the Transformative Voting Hypothesis,"Depression is the leading cause of illness and disability in adolescence. Many studies show a correlation between religiosity and mental health, yet the question remains whether the relationship is causal. We exploit within-school variation in adolescents’ peers to deal with selection into religiosity. We find robust effects of religiosity on depression that are stronger for the most depressed. These effects are not driven by the school social context; depression spreads among close friends rather than through broader peer groups that affect religiosity. Exploration of mechanisms suggests that religiosity buffers against stressors in ways in which school activities and friendships do not."
The Impact of Management Practices on Employee Productivity: A Field Experiment with Airline Captains,"Folk wisdom has long held that people become more politically conservative as they grow older, although several empirical studies suggest political attitudes are stable across time. Using data from the Michigan Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, we analyze attitudinal change over a major portion of the adult life span. We document changes in party identification, self-reported ideology, and selected issue positions over this time period and place these changes in context by comparing them with contemporaneous national averages. Consistent with previous research but contrary to folk wisdom, our results indicate that political attitudes are remarkably stable over the long term. In contrast to previous research, however, we also find support for folk wisdom: on those occasions when political attitudes do shift across the life span, liberals are more likely to become conservatives than conservatives are to become liberals, suggesting that folk wisdom has some empirical basis even as it overstates the degree of change."
Security Actor-Network Theory: Revitalizing Securitization Theory with Bruno Latour,"This paper compares policy outcomes under the runoff voting system and the plurality rule by exploiting the assignment of municipalities in Italy to different voting systems based on a population threshold. Mayors, who are the head of the local political power, are elected using a plurality rule in municipalities having fewer than 15,000 residents, while they are elected using a runoff system in municipalities above the threshold. Regression-discontinuity estimates show that municipalities under the runoff system spend 12 percent more than those under the plurality rule and that additional expenditures are not financed via higher taxation."
"Democracy, Interpretation, and the “Problem” of Conceptual Ambiguity: Reflections on the V-Dem Project’s Struggles with Operationalizing Deliberative Democracy","Government outsourcing of services to private sector entities is increasingly common. The conventional wisdom ties governments’ outsourcing decisions to either an ideological preference for market-based solutions or fiscal pressures. However, these conjectures have not been systematically subjected to empirical scrutiny. I develop an aggregate annual measure of US state-level outsourcing decisions—macro outsourcing—and explore whether the evidence supports these pathways. I also point to an underappreciated political pathway by which potential losers—bureaucrats organized into public sector unions—affect the decision to outsource. The results offer little support for the received wisdom and instead demonstrate that states with strong unions are less likely to rely on private actors. I bolster this finding with preliminary analyses showing that states with laws that sap union power exhibit higher levels of outsourcing. Overall, these results show that outsourcing is a decidedly political phenomenon, albeit via an unexpected route."
Raw fear in Hong Kong,"Since his rise to the political stage in 2015, Donald Trump’s heterodox style of self-presentation has stirred heated metapragmatic debates within the American and international public: Was that “locker-room talk,” or abusive speech? Is his verbal irreverence an unacceptable defiance of fundamental principles of interactional ethics, or a brave attempt at reforming contemporary American speech by dismissing the epistemic inaccuracy and moral hypocrisy of political correctness? This article engages these debates by analyzing an ingenious form of typographic parody that recently appeared on digital social media. Modeled on Trump’s handwriting, the font “Tiny Hand” operates on multiple metapragmatic levels. First, the font’s childlike shapes establish an iconic connection between Trump’s hand(writing) and his brain, which, incapable of adult reasoning, generates dangerously infantile political decisions. Second, as a replica of Trump’s handwriting, the font parodies the president’s habit of correcting journalists with handwritten marginalia, thus speaking back to his attempts at silencing the press. Third, Tiny Hand works as a counter-meta-parody of the president’s political incorrectness. Finally, by evoking the parodies of Trump’s allegedly diminutive hands (and implicitly small penis) that circulated during the electoral race, the font operates as an inside joke addressed at and indexical of Trump’s counterpublic."
Why We Disagree About Human Nature edited by Elizabeth Hannon and Tim Lewens,"According to the orthodox treatment of risk preferences in decision theory, they are to be explained in terms of the agent’s desires about concrete outcomes. The orthodoxy has been criticized both for conflating two types of attitudes and for committing agents to attitudes that do not seem rationally required. To avoid these problems, it has been suggested that an agent’s attitudes to risk should be captured by a risk function that is independent of her utility and probability functions. The main problem with that approach is that it suggests that attitudes to risk are wholly distinct from people’s (non-instrumental) desires. To overcome this problem, we develop a framework where an agent’s utility function is defined over chance propositions (that is, propositions describing objective probability distributions) as well as ordinary (non-chance) ones, and argue that one should explain different risk attitudes in terms of different forms of the utility function over such propositions. 1 Introduction2 Risk Attitudes in the von Neumann–Morgenstern Framework  2.1 Conceptual challenges  2.2 Empirical challenges3 Risk-Weighted Expected Utility Theory  3.1 Risk-weighted expected utility versus expected utility  3.2 Problems with risk-weighted expected utility theory4 Risk Attitudes in the Jeffrey Framework  4.1 Linearity, chance neutrality, and risk aversion  4.2 Distinguishing risk attitudes  4.3 Ambiguity and the four-fold patter5 Conclusion"
A Signaling Theory of Distributive Policy Choice: Evidence from Senegal,"Conventional wisdom holds that political elites harbor more ideologically constrained issue attitudes and are more polarized on such issues than their mass counterparts. In contrast, the mass public is more polarized in its emotional reactions to political stimuli. How affective polarization among the mass public compares to affective polarization among elites is, however, an open question. Using items common to the Convention Delegate Studies and American National Election Studies, I compare the mass public to political elites when it comes to both affective and ideological polarization. I find that elites are more affectively polarized than the mass public and more affectively polarized than they are ideologically polarized, although mass affective polarization has increased over time. These findings provide context for understanding the extent to which the mass public has affectively polarized and demonstrate that elites, despite ideological capabilities, exhibit extreme emotional reactions toward political groups just like their mass counterparts."
"Populism, Partisan Convergence, and Mobilization in Western Europe","Climate change is a global externality that has proven difficult to address through formal institutions alone due to the public good properties of climate change mitigation and the lack of a supranational institution for enforcing global treaties. Given these circumstances, which are arguably the most challenging for international cooperation, commitment problems and free-riding incentives for countries to delay costly mitigation efforts are major obstacles to effective environmental agreements. Starting from this premise, we examine domestic mitigation efforts, with the goal of assessing the extent to which the willingness of individuals to contribute voluntarily to the public good of climate mitigation could be scaled up to the global level. Although individual environmental actions are clearly insufficient for achieving ambitious global mitigation targets, we argue that they are nevertheless initial and essential steps in the right direction. In fact, individual and community efforts may be particularly important if local interventions encourage shifts in norms and behaviors that favor large-scale transformations. With this in mind, we discuss the importance of the visibility of norms and the role of beliefs when such visibility is lacking and their implications for leveraging cooperative behavior to increase climate mitigation efforts locally and globally."
Where Self-Interest Trumps Ideology: Liberal Homeowners and Local Opposition to Housing Development,"Throughout the 2016 US presidential election, pundits repeatedly described Donald Trump as a performance artist and his campaign as performance art. Meanwhile, his alt-right supporters were mounting performance art shows, debating the meaning of Marina Abramović’s work, and developing their own theories of political performance. For experts in performance theory, such punditry and provocation is like the image in a funhouse mirror. It’s hard to make sense of such bizarre, distorted images—let alone to recognize ourselves in them. This article insists that, nonetheless, we should try. Trump and his movement pose special challenges to American political culture—and also to academic performance theory. His rise has revealed the limitations of a politics (and performance theory) based on norms and their transgression. It has also given the lie to politicians’ false belief that they (and only they) are not performing their politics. The challenge now—for academics, activists, citizens, and journalists alike—is to articulate how performance works, how it provides models of cultural power."
"Solving Collective Action Problems under Separated and Shared Powers: The Benefits of Consolidating Executive Budgetary Powers, 1895–1940","Various results show the ‘formal equivalence’ of kin and group selectionist methodologies, but this does not preclude there being a real and useful distinction between kin and group selection processes. I distinguish individual- and population-centred approaches to drawing such a distinction, and I proceed to develop the latter. On the account I advance, the differences between kin and group selection are differences of degree in the structural properties of populations. A spatial metaphor (‘K-G space’) provides a useful framework for thinking about these differences: kin and group selection may be conceptualized as large, overlapping regions of K-G space. I then consider some implications of the account, defend it from possible objections, and further argue that the structural features characteristic of both kin and group selection may recur at multiple levels of biological organization. 1 Introduction2 Equivalence Results and Their Limitations  2.1 An example of an equivalence result  2.2 Limitations3 Individual- and Population-Centred Approaches4 Two Influences: Hamilton and Godfrey-Smith5 K and G  5.1 K  5.2 G  5.3 K-G space6 The rb ≠ 0 Requirement7 Levels of Organization8 The Key Substantive Questions"
Religion and Depression in Adolescence,"Recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in Thoreau’s views of political resistance. Eager to transcend liberal (and especially Rawlsian) ideas of civil disobedience, scholars of political obligation are tapping Thoreau to justify a broader understanding of legitimate lawbreaking than Rawls and many others countenanced. Despite some strengths, the Thoreauvian revival among theorists of political obligation relies on a selective interpretation of its progenitor, sometimes anachronistically transforming him into a defender of a strict duty to political resistance as a path to radical change. Others now following Thoreau reproduce his ambivalent views of democratic politics and far-reaching antilegalism, both of which impede a proper understanding of politically motivated lawbreaking as a potentially legitimate mode of democratic political action. This article briefly considers the possibility that Thoreau can nonetheless help us understand modern individual whistleblowing: some of its key features seem to mesh with his ideas."
Do People Really Become More Conservative as They Age?,"How should social scientists measure institutional complexity? Formal (textually defined) institutional design—and particularly the complexity of formal institutions—is an important object of study across political science, law, and public administration. However, because of measurement constraints, existing work on formal institutional design focuses either on single policy areas or “important” legislation, creating clear selection problems. In this article, I propose and validate a novel natural language processing approach designed to extract networks of institutional relationships from legal texts scalably. These “implementing networks” offer a straightforward way to represent the institutional content of law and naturally suggest measures for quantities like institutional complexity. I then apply this method to measure institutional complexity in all American laws enacted from 1993 to 2014. This approach reveals a surprising disconnect between partisan disagreement and institutional complexity among lower-profile legislation, which would have been difficult to detect without this approach."
Voting Systems and Fiscal Policy: Evidence from Runoff and Plurality Elections,"In the protest movement in Hong Kong in 2019, the growing influence of Mainland China was perceived to be responsible for the erosion of freedom of speech, skyrocketing housing prices, the dwindling of welfare resources, and other social issues. I suggest that assigning guilt to Mainland China for all of the frustrations of Hong Kong’s residents reproduces the mystique of the power of the authoritarian regime and takes attention away from the structural violence in daily life that has led to conflict, confrontation, fragmentation, and discrimination. This article traces the historical trajectory of Hong Kong’s colonial and post-handover governance and political economy to contextualize the structural violence in everyday lives. It then shows how the blame of such structural violence is put on immigrants from Mainland China, the victims of such violence."
Macro Outsourcing: Evaluating Government Reliance on the Private Sector,"This is a review essay reflecting on six recent publications addressing the question of the power of the presidency. The publications reviewed are Jeremy D. Bailey’s The Idea of Presidential Representation: An Intellectual and Political History, Sarah Burns’s The Politics of War Powers: The Theory and History of Presidential Unilateralism, Stephen F. Knott’s The Lost Soul of the American Presidency: The Decline into Demagoguery and the Prospects for Renewal, David J. Siemers’s The Myth of Coequal Branches: Restoring the Constitution’s Separation of Functions, Jeffrey Tulis’s The Rhetorical Presidency, and Mariah Zeisberg’s War Powers: The Politics of Constitutional Authority."
The “Tiny Hand” of Donald Trump and the Metapragmatics of Typographic Parody,"Authoritarianism has become increasingly associated with Republican partisanship and vote choice for Republican candidates in presidential elections. Many have relied on this fact to explain the forces giving rise to Donald Trump’s successful presidential run in 2016. But is authoritarianism driving changes in partisanship and candidate preference? Despite the wide reach of research on authoritarianism and political outcomes, the vast majority of this research rests solely on correlational analyses. This article addresses this shortcoming with two panel studies. In both cases, the findings show a more consistent and stronger reverse temporal relationship between support for Republicans and the child-rearing measure of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism is not exogenous from political attitudes as widely assumed. Instead, the authoritarian divide appears to be largely a product of cue taking on the part of the electorate mimicking their political leaders."
What Is Risk Aversion?,"To explore the effect of federal institutions on national political conflict, we develop a model of two-level governance with interstate preference heterogeneity and cross-state externalities. Our analysis calls into question the conventional interpretation of federalism as a conflict-minimizing institution. We show that polarization over national policy may be higher in federal than unitary systems, even holding policy demand constant. We also show that the incentives for low and high demanders to engage in costly conflict are contingent on the status quo national policy, and we identify conditions under which those incentives and the deadweight cost of political conflict are higher under federalism than unitary governance. The model helps account for a number of empirical regularities in US politics and policy making."
Issues versus Affect: How Do Elite and Mass Polarization Compare?,"Jürgen Habermas has sought to set critical theory on firm normative foundations by drawing on thinkers outside the canon of Western Marxism. My basic thesis is that Hannah Arendt is a crucial but underappreciated resource for his intellectual development. To make this point, I focus on Arendt’s importance for Habermas’s work on the public sphere in the 1960s and the social theory he developed in the 1970s and ‘80s, despite his reluctance to cite her writings in his early career. More generally, I argue that rereading Habermas’s critical theory through Arendt’s political thought helps to clarify the importance of politics within his work, thus countering accusations that he is an abstract thinker of “high liberalism” who is uninterested in “real politics.” A greater appreciation of Arendt’s work as a condition of possibility for Habermas’s philosophy demonstrates the importance of reading their work together as part of a common project."
"Reassessing Quasi-experiments: Policy Evaluation, Induction, and SUTVA","This article defends the use of quasi-experiments for causal estimation in economics against the widespread objection that quasi-experimental estimates lack external validity. The defence is that quasi-experimental replication of estimates can yield defeasible evidence for external validity. The article then develops a different objection. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), on which quasi-experiments rely, is argued to be implausible due to the influence of social interaction effects on economic outcomes. A more plausible stable marginal unit treatment value assumption (SMUTVA) is proposed, but it is demonstrated to severely limit the usefulness of quasi-experiments for economic policy evaluation. 1. Introduction2. Causal Effects in Econometrics3. The Epistemological Problem3.1. The structural approach3.2. The quasi-experimental approach3.3. The external validity objection3.3.1. Narrow and broad causal effects3.3.2. Extrapolation and external validity3.4. Replication and induction4. The Conceptual Problem4.1. Counterfactual interventions and SUTVA4.2. The social interaction objection4.2.1. From SUTVA to SMUTVA4.2.2. The implications of SMUTVA4.3. Induction again?5. Conclusion"
"A Senegambian King in an Englishman’s Bed: The King of Saloum, Francis Moore, and the Making of Early Modern Sovereignty","This article explores the interactions between the English Royal African Company agent Francis Moore and the king of Saloum, which Moore described in Travels into the Inland Parts of Africa (1738). The king, in his efforts to maintain royal control over the slave trade, twice occupied the English company’s upriver warehouse, taking possession of it and its goods for his own use. I argue that situating such extant travel accounts within the political circumstances of the encounters that generated them—the politics at the intersection—as well as the politics shaping their reception—the politics of the intersection—illuminates the cross-cultural production of ideas about and practices of sovereignty in western Europe and Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. Paying special attention to how Moore’s account contributed to the coalescence of the figure of the African despot in European political discourse, the essay roots this trope in European experiences of subjection in the centralized Wolof/Serer military kingdom of Saloum."
“Save Auburn Avenue for Our Black Heritage”: Debating Development in Post–Civil Rights Atlanta,"This article investigates debates concerning the redevelopment of Atlanta’s historic Black business district, “Sweet” Auburn Avenue, in the 1980s. It argues that the revitalization debates suggest two ways of conceptualizing the post–civil rights era; first, as an era of limits in which shifts in the global economy and the national political landscape narrowed the scope of what liberal Black politicians and civic activists believed what politically possible, and second, as an era of anxiety in which political and economic crises fostered nostalgia about the Black past and uncertainty about the future of Black Americans. Focusing on the divisions that emerged among Black Atlantans over the creation of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic Site and the construction of the Auburn Avenue Research Library, the article analyzes how the political-economic constraints and anxieties of the period informed various visions of redevelopment. In doing so, it reveals how the conditions of the post–civil rights era, and the affect produced by them, structured urban Black politics in the last quarter of the twentieth century."
The Intersection of Racial and Partisan Discrimination: Evidence from a Correspondence Study of Four-Year Colleges,"Social decisions are often imbued with biases that can lead to discrimination against certain groups of people. Racial minorities frequently find themselves on the receiving end of such discrimination. Recent work also reveals partisan bias such that members of one political party unfairly favor their copartisans or discriminate against members of the other party. In this article, we use an e-mail correspondence study to explore the impact of racial and partisan discrimination in higher education. We find no direct evidence of a racial or political bias; however, we do find that African Americans who reference politics in any way receive substantially fewer responses. This coheres with the theory of racial threat: members of a majority group are averse to minorities who might threaten their political, economic, or social status."
"Word Embeddings: What Works, What Doesn’t, and How to Tell the Difference for Applied Research","Word embeddings are becoming popular for political science research, yet we know little about their properties and performance. To help scholars seeking to use these techniques, we explore the effects of key parameter choices—including context window length, embedding vector dimensions, and pretrained versus locally fit variants—on the efficiency and quality of inferences possible with these models. Reassuringly we show that results are generally robust to such choices for political corpora of various sizes and in various languages. Beyond reporting extensive technical findings, we provide a novel crowdsourced “Turing test”–style method for examining the relative performance of any two models that produce substantive, text-based outputs. Our results are encouraging: popular, easily available pretrained embeddings perform at a level close to—or surpassing—both human coders and more complicated locally fit models. For completeness, we provide best practice advice for cases where local fitting is required."
"Populists, Clients, and US Immigration Wars","The anthropology of morality continues to be met with resistance. Opposition rests on the perception that one cannot study morals without moralizing or advocating which makes it both epistemologically and professionally questionable. This blinkered view of the objectives of moral anthropology ignores the differences in approaches which need to be considered if epistemic integrity is the real issue. Since most criticisms are aimed at Didier Fassin and Nancy Scheper-Hughes, I argue that the issue is political and that this singling out of their work raises its own set of questions regarding professional ethics. With reference to my own work and others who focus on embodied moralities, I show that neither moralizing nor advocating are an inevitable consequence of this approach and that the study of morals has genuine ethnographic value."
Moral anthropology: A critique of criticism,"William Graham Sumner is popularly thought of as the Progressive Era’s strongest champion of the unencumbered individual, following Richard Hofstadter’s identification of Sumner as “one of America’s preeminent and influential social Darwinists.” Sumner scholars have increasingly pushed back against this characterization, pointing to the roles of cooperation and the “law of sympathy” within Sumner’s writings. However, the revision of Sumner has remained focused on the texts that Hofstadter identified as Sumner’s “political” writings. This article argues that such a focus would have confused Sumner, who saw the study of politics as intimately tied to the study of history. Reconstructing Sumner’s political thought by contextualizing his “political” writings in his understanding of historical development and his extended historical accounts, the article argues that Sumner understood civil liberty not as an abstract concept but as an empirical fact that emerged from the interplay of historical forces."
"“An Affair of History, Law, and Institutions”: William Graham Sumner’s Historical Method and the Responsibility of the Individual","This article examines the transnational work that since the 1990s has increasingly opposed abortion in terms of protecting women. It therefore explores how pro-woman rhetoric is used to foster right-wing politics by way of, and beyond, the fight over abortion. Narratives depicting white women as dupes of a sordid, satanic system of abortion provision ignore the fact that most women report feeling relief—not grief, regret, or trauma—after terminating an unwanted pregnancy. To get a sense of the political and cultural influence that right-wing movements gain when they play the woman card, we must trace antiabortion collaborations transnationally. Reading representations of “woman” cross-culturally and intersectionally, this article analyzes the political collusions and cultural work achieved by depicting white women as victims of abortion. To do so I focus on three countries where national identity is especially bound up with whiteness and where abortion is particularly contested: Ireland, Russia, and the United States. This cross-cultural look at antiabortion collaboration reveals a transnational traffic in tactics, personnel, and funds that fuel right-wing politics and ideology and that therefore contribute to the global rise of the Right that characterizes the contemporary moment."
Opposing Abortion to Protect Women: Transnational Strategy since the 1990s,"What kind of moral and sentimental education should we pursue under non-ideal circumstances? In states characterized by high inequality and imperfect political institutions, scholars have increasingly turned their attention to the ethics of care and the politics of compassion. In response, critics have raised concerns that compassion is too weak to serve politically salutary goals. Drawing on the moral and political psychology of Emile, this article shows that Rousseau relied on fear, anxiety, and amour-propre to extend compassion across class lines. Rousseau’s account suggests that the proper development of compassion cannot do without these more “dangerous” allies, at least not in societies characterized by socioeconomic inequality. In addition to its contribution to Rousseau scholarship, the article adds to the contemporary literature on moral sentiments by highlighting three psychologically plausible and previously unacknowledged strategies for extending compassion: fear of downward social mobility, religious anxiety, and pride."
"Compassion’s More Dangerous Allies: Fear, Anxiety, and Amour-Propre","Democratic accountability relies on citizens to anticipate future governing behavior. We explore the strategic incentives for parties to shape voter expectations by generating vague or concrete campaign statements. Using an English-language dictionary, we scale electoral statements from all industrialized English-speaking nations to develop a measure of concreteness. Concrete statements can create electoral risks from unfulfilled expectations. Yet, political parties have incentives to use concrete statements to clarify reputation uncertainty associated with unclear informational cues. Political context shapes these incentives. Incumbent parties tend to dictate concrete statements to balance attributed responsibility for government outcomes and signal that they are competent managers. Strong government performance, however, reduces the incentive for incumbents to be concrete, as favorable outcomes reveal competent management. Opposition parties are unconstrained from these demands. The research reveals how political parties actively manage and balance the information that voters use in order to adjust the informative value of party reputation."
Resist to Commit: Concrete Campaign Statements and the Need to Clarify a Partisan Reputation,"Do voters prefer dominant looking candidates in times of war? By replicating previous survey experiments, we find that respondents do prefer candidates with dominant facial features when war is salient. We then investigate whether these survey results generalize to the real world. Examining US Senate elections from 1990 to 2006, we test whether voters prefer candidates with dominant facial features in wartime elections more than in peacetime elections. In contrast with the survey studies, we find that dominant-looking candidates appear to gain a slight advantage in all elections but have no special advantage in wartime contexts. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy between the findings and conduct additional experiments to investigate one possible explanation: additional information about candidates may rapidly erode the wartime preference for dominant looking candidates. Overall, our findings suggest that the dominance-war findings may not generalize to the real world."
Facial Dominance and Electoral Success in Times of War and Peace,"The study of agenda power has largely been the study of negative agenda power. But standard measures of negative agenda power are insufficient to measure the majority’s agenda choices: they only consider a small proportion of bills, only detail how often negative agenda power fails (rather than succeeds), and cannot help us understand positive agenda power. To understand the incentives and strategies of agenda decision-making, then, we must know about members’ preferences on all bills. I develop an approach to estimate members’ preferences on all bills, by generating quantitative characterizations of the policy content in each bill. I use the resulting estimates to examine both positive and negative agenda power using all bills and to directly compare levels of agenda power between chambers of the US Congress. While I find similarly strong negative agenda control in both chambers, I find substantially stronger positive agenda control in the House than the Senate."
Condoning Unspeakable Things (Dubal's Against Humanity: Lessons from the Lord’s Resistance Army),"Mass protests erupted in June 2019 in Hong Kong due to widespread anger about a proposed amendment to the extradition law. As a global project, could the goal of pursuing democratization be narrowly confined to a single place such as Hong Kong? What can be learned from a leaderless democratic movement, by those who are concerned about the future of Hong Kong? Can we learn some lessons from the Hong Kong movement—from the nuanced actions, complex strategies of mobilization, and the huge number of movement participants—and reflect upon them? Radical refers not only to the escalation of physical force but also the alternative imagination and praxis of democratic visions that should be bigger than the movement at this stage. Hong Kong is a global city; it deserves a radical politics aimed at linking transnational social movements that could possibly transgress the localistic approach of social struggles."
"Muscular Christianity and Spiritual Abuse (Johnson's Biblical Porn: Affect, Labor, and Pastor Mark Driscoll’s Evangelical Empire)","Many states have become concerned with Russian cyberattacks and online propaganda. The Ukrainian government responded to the information threat in 2017 by blocking access to several Russian websites, including VKontakte, one of the most popular social media websites in Ukraine. By exploiting a natural experiment in Ukraine, I find that the sudden censorship policy reduced activity on VKontakte, despite the fact that a vast majority of the users were legally and technically able to bypass the ban. Users with strong political and social affiliations to Russia were at least as likely to be affected by the ban as those with weak affiliations. I argue that the ease of access to online media—not political attitudes toward the state—was the main mechanism behind the users’ response to the ban. These findings suggest that this pragmatic view on the effects of censorship holds, even in the highly politicized military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which later evolved into a full-scale Russian invasion."
Bill Text and Agenda Control in the US Congress,"How do parties respond to public opinion shifts on the campaign trail? While a vast literature looks at ideological updating across elections, the dynamics of short-term responsiveness remain largely a black box. I argue that campaign rhetoric reflects parties’ need to balance office and policy goals. Shifts in voter preferences alter the salience of these goals, leading parties to adjust their strategies. A novel data set combining opinion polls with campaign statements by 68 European parties provides support for this argument. Parties performing well in the campaign pursue their dominant aims. However, when voters shift away from a party, leaders are impelled to accommodate their secondary goals: mainstream parties polarize to secure the support of core voters, while niche parties moderate their rhetoric to guarantee survival in parliament. The fluidity of party positioning uncovered here helps in enlightening multiple questions left open by previous studies of policy responsiveness."
Reflecting on Hong Kong protests in 2019–2020,"In the years after 1945, German Protestant church leaders and lay intellectuals emerged as ubiquitous critics of the war crimes trials conducted by the Allied occupation governments. Marshaling the financial resources and international connections of the newly formed Protestant Church in Germany, a network of church administrators, theologians, and jurists petitioned occupation authorities for the release of hundreds of convicted Nazi perpetrators. While a generation of critical scholarship has linked the campaign against war crimes trials to the persistence of Protestant nationalism in Allied-occupied Germany, this article argues that the campaign also marked an inflection point in postwar German politics. Protestant church leaders and jurists not only echoed popular attacks on Allied “victors’ justice” but also developed a novel language of human rights that would shape their later interventions in West German politics. Rejecting the dominant contemporary discourses of human rights, rooted in Catholic natural law or American exceptionalism, Protestant trial opponents recentered human rights around a theology of human fallibility in order to criticize the alleged excesses of political justice. Yet even as they promoted tendentious accounts of the Nazi past, Protestant leaders contributed to institutionalizing human rights in West German politics. By the 1950s, veterans of the postwar amnesty campaigns would defend the rights of conscientious objectors and recognition of Germany’s territorial losses. The Protestant campaign against war crimes trials demonstrates how human rights gained power in postwar Germany as a political language that bridged nationalist and internationalist commitments, with ambiguous consequences for the consolidation of democracy."
Fighting Propaganda with Censorship: A Study of the Ukrainian Ban on Russian Social Media,"This article examines initial-condition dependence and initial-condition uncertainty for climate projections and predictions. The first contribution is to provide a clear conceptual characterization of predictions and projections. Concerning initial-condition dependence, projections are often described as experiments that do not depend on initial conditions. Although prominent, this claim has not been scrutinized much and can be interpreted differently. If interpreted as the claim that projections are not based on estimates of the actual initial conditions of the world or that what makes projections true are conditions in the world, this claim is true. However, it can also be interpreted as the claim that simulations used to obtain projections are independent of initial-condition ensembles. This article argues that evidence does not support this claim. Concerning initial-condition uncertainty, three kinds of initial-condition uncertainty are identified (two have received little attention from philosophers so far). The first (the one usually discussed) is the uncertainty associated with the spread of the ensemble simulations. The second arises because the theoretical initial ensemble cannot be used in calculations and has to be approximated by finitely many initial states. The third uncertainty arises because it is unclear how long the model should be run to obtain potential initial conditions at pre-industrial times. Overall, the discussion shows that initial-condition dependence and uncertainty in climate science are more complex and important issues than usually acknowledged. 1. Introduction2. Projections and Predictions 2.1. Predictions2.2. Projections3. Initial-Condition Dependence 3.1. Projections 3.1.1. Dynamical conditions justifying independence of initial conditions?3.1.2. What projections can and cannot provide3.2. Predictions4. Initial-Condition Uncertainty 4.1. Projections4.2. Predictions5. ConclusionAppendix"
Responsive Campaigning: Evidence from European Parties,"AbstractLegal and political claims about environmental chemicals typically address such substances on a molecule-by-molecule basis. This article argues that this approach is not determined solely by the nature of chemicals. Rather, it is the product of legal structures, administrative procedures, regulatory lists, information systems, and nomenclature conventions, which I collectively term “molecular bureaucracy.” This article traces the development of molecular bureaucracy, a global framework of environmental governance grounded in American regulatory infrastructure, and its political and environmental consequences. It does so by following the history of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, synthetic chemicals in widespread use since the 1950s whose toxicity has become a prominent subject of research and public concern since the late 1990s. Molecular bureaucracy originated in a classification system based on molecular identity developed to make chemical information accessible to the late nineteenth-century synthetic chemicals industry. It came to structure environmental law and politics through, first, the efforts of 1960s US policy-makers to render toxic hazards subject to government control through computer-based information coordination and, second, a vision of chemical holism within the nascent US Environmental Protection Agency and the Toxic Substances Control Act, which sought to accommodate the global environment to rational administration by aggregating diverse toxic hazards and reframing them as abstract chemical substances. The history of molecular bureaucracy offers valuable insights for present-day efforts to ground toxic substances scholarship and politics in alternative conceptions of environmental chemicals."
"“The Limits of Human Jurisdiction”: Protestantism, War Crimes Trials, and Human Rights in Occupied Germany","Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party is concentrating efforts on the cultivation of outstanding local cadres in order to improve local governance. For this purpose, it is strengthening the functions of local Party schools that offer students both political and administrative education to create a cohort of cadres who are both “red and expert.” We discuss how this is done in terms of curriculum planning, types of classes, and the student pool, using the example of County Z Party School. We find that since the national Eighteenth Party Congress, the Central Committee has reinforced its control over local Party schools to ensure that their curriculum and the methods they use to train cadres are consistent with national Party directives, as part of Beijing’s efforts to strengthen the Party’s grassroots governance."
Initial-Condition Dependence and Initial-Condition Uncertainty in Climate Science,"The prospect of judicial review may cause legislators to adjust their behavior to anticipate the court’s response. This can serve as a source of moral hazard for legislators. Legislators can pursue irresponsible policies that are potentially electorally valuable and then rely on the court to bail them out by overturning the policy before implementation. We examine this issue by extending a seminal model of judicial review to include review both before the implementation of policy (ex ante review) and after the implementation of policy (ex post review). Our analysis shows that the moral hazard concerns are reduced when review occurs after policy costs are realized because politicians self-discipline. However, the full welfare implications for voters are complex, and each form of review has advantages."
Molecular Bureaucracy: Toxicological Information and Environmental Protection,"In July and August 2010, a series of spontaneous “defend-my-mother-tongue” protests took place in Guangzhou. At its climax, thousands of protestors took to the streets to oppose a government proposal to switch local television broadcasts from Cantonese to Mandarin. Unlike other recent mass incidents in China, the “Defend Cantonese” protests mainly involved a place-based identity politics through which participants purported to support maintenance of Cantonese culture without explicit political and material demands. Based on the testimonies of dozens of participants and witnesses, the authors identify three sets of schematic dichotomies that framed the protests: namely, south versus north, local differences versus national uniformity, and conserving traditional Guangzhou versus urban redevelopment. It is argued that underpinning the language movement’s cultural outlook was the participants’ discontent with current politics and distribution of resources. The cultural packaging constitutes a specific tactic through which the actors resisted the authoritarian regime without triggering violent suppression."
Ideological Education and Practical Training at a County Party School: Shaping Local Governance in Contemporary China,"Historians and other scholars of memory have worked extensively on European memory politics, especially around transnational issues such as the Holocaust, as well as on Spanish memory politics, most recently in light of the exhumation of former dictator Francisco Franco. Yet there has been little scholarship to date on how nationally specific incidents, such as the Spanish Civil War and Franco regime, fit into wider trans-European narratives. This article reveals the entanglements between these local and supranational developments by examining the evolution of Spain’s memory laws and discourse, from the 1977 Amnesty Law that followed the end of the Franco regime to the 2007 Law of Historical Memory, in relation to contemporaneous European memorialization patterns. It argues that the shift from a discourse of forgetting in the Amnesty Law to one of commemoration in the Law of Historical Memory is a response to the rise of a European culture of memorialization rather than reflecting an evolution in Spain’s memory regime. By analyzing the development, text, and application of these laws, along with the political and cultural debates surrounding them in Spain and throughout Europe, this article reveals how the 2007 Spanish Law of Historical Memory, despite appearing to espouse European discourses of memorialization and amends-making, perpetuates a system of disremembering that predates most contemporary European memory politics. Ultimately, the article argues that the Law of Historical Memory suppresses the voices of victims of the Franco regime in order to bolster a narrative of Spanish national unity and European belonging."
Judicial Review Timing and Legislative Posturing: Reconsidering the Moral Hazard Problem,"Chinese local governments wield their enormous political power and administrative capacity to provide “special deals” for favored private firms. We argue that China’s extraordinary economic growth comes from these special deals. Local political leaders do so because they derive personal benefits, either political or monetary, from providing special deals. Competition between local governments limits the predatory effects of special deals."
Culture versus the State? The “Defend-My-Mother-Tongue” Protests in Guangzhou,"Drawing on evidence from semistructured interviews and an original survey, this article examines the policy influence of Provincial People’s Congress deputies and reveals how deputies who lack substantial power enhance their influence. Deputies mainly use two types of strategies: improving the persuasiveness of policy suggestions, which includes gathering information and providing specific and feasible solutions, and strengthening interactions with other political actors, through face-to-face persuasion, pressuring relevant departments, gaining support from congress leaders, and seeking support from public opinion. The article demonstrates how such strategies help some of the deputies make a difference in China’s policy-making process."
"“A Forgetting for Everyone, by Everyone”? Spain’s Memory Laws and the Rise of the European Community of Memory, 1977–2007","The American politics literature on representation focuses on voters and elected officials, but a growing group of political scientists are arguing that more should be done to study interest groups. Yet there already is a large literature on interest groups, and it has struggled to show evidence of interest group influence. I argue here that the interest group literature’s near-exclusive focus on the federal government has hindered its progress: basic questions have gone unasked, important interest groups have gone underappreciated, and the amount of influence has been underestimated. By studying US subnational policy making, scholars would discover different constellations of interest groups, and they would find that the variation in subnational governments allows for empirical designs that are better able to detect interest group influence when it exists. The payoffs of a subnational focus would be substantial—both for our understanding of interest groups and for the study of political representation."
Special Deals with Chinese Characteristics,"In recent years, political scientists have made extensive use of spatial econometric models to test a wide range of theories. In a review of spatial papers, we find that a majority of these studies use the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model. Although this is a powerful method that reveals inferences about diffusion processes, it is also highly restrictive and makes assumptions that often are not appropriate given the expressed theories. We contend that spatial-X (SLX) models are a better reflection of typical theories about spatial processes. Our simulations demonstrate that SLX models consistently retrieve the direct and indirect effects of covariates when the true data-generating process reflects other spatial processes. SAR models, however, tend to find phantom higher-order effects that are not present in the data. We further demonstrate how SLX models reveal heterogeneity in patterns of spatial dependence in countries’ defense burdens that SAR models cannot discover."
Getting Their Voices Heard: Strategies of China’s Provincial People’s Congress Deputies to Influence Policies,"Left-wing politics is resurgent. Self-proclaimed socialists are unexpectedly popular. Proposals like universal health care are a commonplace of Democratic campaigns. But there is not yet a clear, unifying idea behind this political shift. We propose that that idea is freedom. While the left once understood freedom as emancipation from the economy, the right spent the twentieth century neutralizing and appropriating the idea of freedom by reinventing the economy as the true site of freedom. To reclaim freedom as a value of the left, we have to begin with the daily experience of most people: the unfreedom of the workplace. The authoritarian organization of work is not just an offense against freedom; it also helps us understand how freedom requires emancipation both from the economy and within the economy, and why that emancipation requires mass struggle."
Looking for Influence in All the Wrong Places: How Studying Subnational Policy Can Revive Research on Interest Groups,"A central challenge in securing property rights is the subversion of justice. We present a model of a polluter whose discharges harm multiple owners, and we compare property rules, liability rules, and regulation on efficiency grounds. We provide conditions under which property rules are preferred to liability rules, thus verifying the Calabresi-Melamed conjecture. Regulation that enforces partial abatement may be preferred to either of the extreme rules. An empirical analysis of water quality in the United States before and after the Clean Water Act shows that the effects of regulation are consistent with several predictions of the model."
X Marks the Spot: Unlocking the Treasure of Spatial-X Models,"Gibbsian statistical mechanics (GSM) is the most widely used version of statistical mechanics among working physicists. Yet a closer look at GSM reveals that it is unclear what the theory actually says and how it bears on experimental practice. The root cause of the difficulties is the status of the averaging principle, the proposition that what we observe in an experiment is the ensemble average of a phase function. We review different stances toward this principle, and eventually present a coherent interpretation of GSM that provides an account of the status and scope of the principle."
Freedom Now,"This essay explores the predicament of subaltern self-racializing in terms of European political and scientific modernity by tracing attempts to reconsider and appropriate the “Mediterranean race” concept on behalf of new and underrecognized nationalisms. The essay develops a perspective that brings together the least obvious global “coauthors” of the counternarrative of the “Mediterranean race”—such as Russian Zionism, turn-of-the-century Italian nationalism, and W. E. B. Du Bois’s “Negritude” nationalism—which were equally engaged in self-racializing and claiming the status of archetypal Europeanness. Jewish self-racializing, in particular, which is usually interpreted as a response to racial anti-Semitism or as an expression of self-hatred, is treated here as a paradigmatic case of subaltern nationalism and subaltern science. Ultimately, the essay explores the hybridizing potential and politics of comparison embedded in the “Mediterranean race” counternarrative that continue to inspire historical and cultural revisionism today."
Securing Property Rights,"This article argues that policy implementation in China has moved toward a system under which the center formulates a blueprint or “top-level design” from which local officials devise detailed regulations through a process of “crossing the river by feeling for stones.” This applies to the development of China’s new social credit system. To minimize political risk, when implementing it local officials have selected easier goals from the “top-level design” blueprint. In City Z, for example, we find that promoting integrity among businesses is less risky than promoting integrity among civil servants or the general public, so less progress has been made in the latter two areas when putting in place integrity credit-point systems. The risks involved in promoting social credit among the general populace are the greatest, so the city’s efforts in this have been limited. From our empirical study of China’s social credit system in City Z, we draw some conclusions about policy implementation under Xi Jinping."
Can Somebody Please Say What Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics Says?,"Situated in China’s Great Leap Forward (GLF) campaign in 1958, this study examines the spatial diffusion of “launching high-yield satellites”—exaggerating grain yields, which contributed to the 1959–61 GLF famine that claimed millions of human lives. The authors conceptualize exaggerating grain yields as a political innovation adopted by local cadres to endorse the GLF and signal political loyalty to their superiors. Using geocoded county-level event history data from historical newspaper archives, the authors found that the diffusion of exaggerating grain yields across the country was primarily driven by the interaction between geographic proximity and political proximity."
Mediterraneanizing Europe: The Project of Subaltern Race and the Postimperial Search for Hybridity,"The health of many marine, coastal, freshwater, and other aquatic ecosystems is           inextricably linked to decisions about the management of water quality and quantity. In           this article we review the economic literature aimed at quantifying the impacts of water           resource management on aquatic species in the United States and the potential welfare           gains of managing water and aquatic species systems jointly. Existing studies consider           multiple water uses, such as agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation, as well as           different societal benefits from aquatic species, such as commercial and recreational           fishing and endangered species preservation. These studies use a variety of methodologies,           including stated and revealed preference techniques, bioeconomic modeling, and           reduced-form econometrics. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for research           that could increase understanding of the trade-offs between water and aquatic species           management outcomes and identify gains from the joint management of water resources and           aquatic species in the United States."
Hobbling Big Brother: Top-Level Design and Local Discretion in China’s Social Credit System,"Popular emotions play a critical role in Polybius’ theory of constitutional changes, or anacyclosis, in his Histories. Emotion coalesces with morality and reason in the changes of state-form (politeia) within Polybius’ political theory, leading to the removal of bad rulers and the reestablishment of a good state-form. Moreover, the people feel these rational emotions and thus preserve communal values. Polybius’ portrayal of the people’s moral emotions is unique in ancient philosophies of state-change, provides an ancient parallel to modern philosophy of emotions, and challenges long-standing scholarly assumptions that for Polybius the people had no beneficial role in politics."
Is Lying Contagious? Spatial Diffusion of High-Yield “Satellites” during China’s Great Leap Forward,"American criminal laws and criminal justice systems are harsher, more punitive, more afflicted by racial disparities and injustices, more indifferent to suffering, and less respectful of human dignity than those of other Western countries. The explanations usually offered—rising crime rates in the 1970s and 1980s, public anger and anxiety, crime control politics, neoliberal economic and social policies—are fundamentally incomplete. The deeper explanations are four features of American history that shaped values, attitudes, and beliefs and produced a political culture in which suffering is fatalistically accepted and policy makers are largely indifferent to individual injustices. They are the history of American race relations, the evolution of Protestant fundamentalism, local election of judges and prosecutors, and the continuing influence of political and social values that emerged during three centuries of western expansion. The last, encapsulated in Frederick Jackson Turner’s “frontier thesis,” is interwoven with the other three. Together, they explain long-term characteristics of American criminal justice and the extraordinary severity of penal policies and practices since the 1970s."
The Economics of the Joint Management of Water Resources and Aquatic Species in the United States,"We analyze how the formal recognition of foreign qualifications affects immigrants’ labor market outcomes. The empirical analysis is based on a novel German data set that links respondents’ survey information to their administrative records, allowing us to observe immigrants at monthly intervals before, during, and after their application for occupational recognition. We find that 3 years after obtaining recognition, immigrants earn 19.8% higher wages and are 24.5 percentage points more likely to be employed than immigrants in the control group. We further document that occupational recognition leads to full convergence of immigrants’ earnings to those of their native counterparts."
The People’s Moral Emotions in Polybius’ Cycle of Constitutions,"I examine the relationship between democratic viability and polarization using a model of electoral manipulation and focusing on the strategic interaction between a policy-seeking incumbent and opposition. I find that polarization has an ambiguous effect on the incumbent’s use of electoral manipulation. I apply the model to several concrete political processes and show that under these additional assumptions, the relationship between manipulation and polarization is inversely U-shaped: manipulation is low at low levels of polarization, peaks when polarization is intermediate, and decreases again as polarization becomes extreme. I show that this relationship is robust to several extensions. Finally, I investigate how the presence of a common democratic safeguard—a court—affects the relationship between polarization and manipulation. I find that the court constrains manipulation only if it is ideologically aligned with the opposition and polarization is low."
Fatalism and Indifference: The Influence of the Frontier on American Criminal Justice,"When do groups—be they countries, administrations, or other organizations—more or less accurately understand the world around them and assess political choices? Some argue that group decision-making processes often fail due to biases induced by groupthink. Others argue that groups, by aggregating knowledge, are better at analyzing the foreign policy world. To advance knowledge about the intersection of politics and group decision making, this paper draws on evidence from a multiyear geopolitical forecasting tournament with thousands of participants sponsored by the US government. We find that teams outperformed individuals in making accurate geopolitical predictions, with regression discontinuity analysis demonstrating specific teamwork effects. Moreover, structural topic models show that more cooperative teams outperformed less cooperative teams. These results demonstrate that information sharing through groups, cultivating reasoning to hedge against cognitive biases, and ensuring all perspectives are heard can lead to greater success for groups at forecasting and understanding politics."
Occupational Recognition and Immigrant Labor Market Outcomes,"This article compares two dominating conceptual frameworks of the current global environmental crisis, the Anthropocene and climate change, with respect to how they can be deployed to think about the dynamics of political action. Whereas the Anthropocene has attracted the attention of audiences beyond specialists and has radically expanded the temporal horizon for politics, its temporal characteristics risk rendering it unhelpful for thinking critically about how the current environmental crisis can be addressed. Most importantly, by establishing a reference point in a distant future from which the present is evaluated, the Anthropocene framework gives the impression that the future is already determined and that the course of future environmental degradation is set. The Anthropocene thus fails to specify what is at stake for politics in the current crisis. As a contrast, the climate-change framework is structured as a range of scenarios. It establishes a temporal structure that opens the present to different potential futures and manifests the fact that the level of emissions in the coming decades is decisive for future climate change but not yet determined. Further, the presence of tipping points in the climate system can be understood in temporal terms as a risk in some scenarios of falling into a temporality of unfolding, a mode in which game-changing events that lead to even more emissions proceed beyond human influence. The risk of entering such a temporality that closes down the possibility to meaningfully deliberate on fundamental aspects of the future increases with the rate of emissions. The climate-change framework in this way helps us understand the environmental crisis in a new way, namely by conceptualizing the open future as a finite resource that has to be distributed globally and across generations. In sum, as a framework for engaging with environmental derangement, the climate-change framework offers a more specific and politically useful temporality than the Anthropocene."
Electoral Manipulation in Polarized Societies,"Consistent with recent scholarship showing the importance of nonjudicial actors in constitutional development, this article uncovers stage legislative responses to the Supreme Court’s liberty-of-contract cases Lochner v. New York (1905) and especially Adkins v. Children’s Hospital (1923). This history shows that, like many political figures of the time, the states first interpreted Lochner narrowly and then, in the wake of Adkins, served as a source of resistance in trying to maintain their police powers. The states’ fight against liberty of contract offers two instructive lessons for contemporary politics. First, it demonstrates that, at least before the New Deal, state actors participated in extrajudicial constitutional interpretation and resistance, attempting to shape constitutional understanding. Second, in showing how this state interpretation was deployed on behalf of a progressive cause, it complicates the commonly understood association of states’ rights federalism with political and racial conservatism."
What Makes Foreign Policy Teams Tick: Explaining Variation in Group Performance at Geopolitical Forecasting,"Despite growing public-sector investment in education in developing economies, there are few studies that have examined the efficacy of these investments. In this paper, we estimate social returns to education in Indonesia, using individual-level data on wages from five waves of the Indonesia Family Life Surveys (1993–2014) and subdistrict-level data on average education levels from the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), a large-scale national-level socioeconomic survey. Our identification strategy rests on the within-sibling variation in average education levels, which is generated because our analysis includes a large sample of siblings who live in different subdistricts. Using sibling fixed effects, we find that a 1-year increase in average education results in a 6%–8% increase in wages. Our results are robust to several robustness checks, including the addition of several controls for labor demand conditions and adjustments for potential measurement error in individual-level education."
On the Difference between Anthropocene and Climate Change Temporalities,"In recent decades the field of anthropology has been characterized as sharply divided between proscience and antiscience factions. The aim of this study is to empirically evaluate that characterization. We survey anthropologists in graduate programs in the United States regarding their views of science and advocacy, moral and epistemic relativism, and the merits of evolutionary biological explanations. We examine anthropologists’ views in concert with their varying appraisals of major controversies in the discipline (Chagnon/Tierney, Mead/Freeman, and Menchú/Stoll). We find that disciplinary specialization and especially gender and political orientation are significant predictors of anthropologists’ views. We interpret our findings through the lens of an intuitionist social psychology that helps explain the dynamics of such controversies as well as ongoing ideological divisions in the field."
Progressivism and States’ Rights: Constitutional Dialogue between the States and Federal Courts on Minimum Wages and Liberty of Contract,"This essay examines techniques of amorous matching in the work of the “utopian socialist” Charles Fourier (1772–1837), recovering the practices and the institutions he proposed for the management of love, as well as his political arguments for their centrality in a perfected society. In doing so, it argues more broadly for the need to position the management of love at the origin of early social science. Much as early defenses of capitalism had at their core a discourse of the passions, so too was Fourier’s socialism invested in exploring how problems of political economy were those of passional economy. To rectify the latter, Fourier attempted to articulate both a mathematical system—a calcul des passions—and a centralized information system for the gathering and sorting of personal data. The recovery of his vision thus has the potential to inform critically a radical politics of algorithmic matching through Big Data—the province today not of utopian socialism but of online dating apps."
Are There Social Returns to Education in Developing Countries? Evidence from Indonesia,"Historians often analyze the US Civil War in the context of political, social, and economic change but fail to appreciate its role in fomenting dramatic developments in temperance and alcohol reform. The war caused rifts between Northern and Southern temperance organizations; disrupted temperance fund-raising, recruitment, and outreach activities; and placed more than a million young men in danger of succumbing to the intemperance then rampant in the Union and Confederate armies. In addition, the Union’s revenue policy levied taxes on distilled and fermented beverages, raising fears among temperance reformers that the federal government sanctioned the production and use of alcohol. In response, new temperance initiatives emerged after the war: increased women’s activism, the resurgence of prohibition in national politics, and new approaches to understanding and treating alcohol abuse. These developments ramified beyond the United States to affect temperance activism internationally."
Anthropology’s Science Wars: Insights from a New Survey,"In this article I develop an account of Frederick Douglass’s use of declaration as an emancipatory mode of political action. An act of declaration compels an audience to acknowledge the declarer as possessing a type of normative standing (e.g., personhood or citizenship). Douglass, through acts of declaration like his Fifth of July speech and fight with the “slavebreaker” Covey, compels American audiences to acknowledge him as a fellow citizen by forcefully enacting a commitment to resist tyranny and oppression. The distinctive emancipatory potential of declaration is grounded in its political epistemology of acknowledgment, on which political actors understand other persons as members of a shared community through the ways in which they comport themselves in relation to one another. Declaration makes political communities more inclusive by changing not only who we understand as fellow members but also how we understand them as such."
"From Harmony to eHarmony: Charles Fourier, Social Science, and the Management of Love","This article explores the uneasy position of Mainlanders within and in relation to the Anti-Extradition Movement amid rising anti-Mainland sentiment in Hong Kong. It shows how the continued reliance on the Chinese language, contact, and media for information, communication, and socialization have contained them within the Chinese “national space,” influencing their perceptions of the Movement and curtailing the discursive space for articulating political views. Meanwhile, language barriers prevent non-Cantonese-speaking Mainlanders from integrating with the local society and participating in the Movement, in which Cantonese is dominant. The nativist sentiment among protestors also makes those who supported or joined the Movement feel marginalized and invisible. It remains a huge challenge for Mainlanders to break down or bridge over such divisions guarded by both the Great Firewall and nativist sentiments in both Mainland China and Hong Kong."
The American Civil War and the Course of Late Nineteenth-Century Temperance Reform,"In Book VI of The Faerie Queene, Spenser figures courtesy as a uniquely self-divided virtue. Alternating between benign and malign manifestations with such ease and rapidity that these seeming opposites become indistinguishable from one another, Spenser’s courtesy is a means of utopian progress and dystopian catastrophe at one and the same time. Embodied as much by the Blatant Beast as the courteous knight who seeks to contain it, the virtue functions less as an instrument of ideological motivation than as an index of the way that historical crisis obscures the difference between culture and its barbarous Other. Book VI ultimately thematizes and trains readers not in a politics per se, but in the critical agency that Spenser describes as “wary boldness,” a proto-political faculty governed by the tension between aesthetic experience and social praxis. The essay concludes by arguing for the value of Adornian theory in thinking through this tension, as it exists in The Faerie Queene, early modern literature, and contemporary critical practice."
Declaration in Douglass’s My Bondage and My Freedom,"Donna Hightower (1926–2013) was an African American jazz expatriate who emigrated to Spain in the late 1960s and settled there until the mid-1990s. At first glance, Hightower’s international tours and musical career in Spain seem unrelated to the broader Black Freedom Struggle. She independently traveled throughout Europe without assistance from other Black jazz expatriates and intentionally disassociated herself from major civil rights and Black Power organizations. However, a closer examination of her life and influence in Spain highlights the diverse ways Black women participated in global politics and cultural diplomacy in the late twentieth century. This article argues that Hightower engaged in three forms of Black internationalism—political activism, public self-fashioning, and Black religious expression—in order to challenge existing social structures in the United States and Spain. In the process, she denounced American racism, uplifted African American religious practices, and presented alternative representations of Black womanhood on a global scale."
Living between incongruous worlds in Hong Kong,"This article presents a new account of the relationship between Michel Foucault’s work and neoliberalism, aiming to show that the relationship is significantly more complicated than either Foucault’s critics or defenders have appreciated in the recent controversy. On the one hand, I argue that Foucault’s salutary response to some of Gary Becker’s ideas in the lecture course from 1979 should be read together with the argument of Discipline and Punish. By means of this contextualization I show that Foucault’s sympathetic response to Becker is limited to the domain of penal practices, specifically concerning the question of how to resist their rationality of normalization, and thus it involves no broader commitment to neoliberal economic theory or its political implications. On the other hand, however, I argue that there is a strategic allegiance between Foucault’s work and the ascendance of the neoliberal rationality of governing, although it has nothing to do with his sympathetic engagement with Becker’s work. Instead, I explain how Foucault’s focus on the political stakes of subjectivity has helped to congeal, in the posthumous neoliberal context, a conception of politics that leaves out the topic of economic equality. To explain how Foucault’s work has had this unintended yet lasting effect, I introduce the concept of topical exclusion. It designates a social mechanism of producing ignorance, which operates by directing attention instead of creating false consciousness. The strategic relationship between Foucault’s work and neoliberalism today illustrates that this type of explanation is essential in the analysis of power relations. Thus, my account motivates the adoption of topical exclusion as a conceptual supplement that equips the Foucaultian framework to study cases in which relations of power harness, produce, and sustain ignorance, not knowledge."
Wary Boldness: Courtesy and Critical Aesthetics in The Faerie Queene,"The development of methods to measure the ideological positions of legislators and other political actors has become one of the most successful research programs in the study of political behavior. Less effort, however, has been given to approaches for measuring public uncertainty about those positions. In this article, we propose the use of a well-known measurement model to investigate public uncertainty about the ideological locations of political actors. To motivate its use empirically, we examine citizens’ perceptions of the ideology of Donald Trump during the 2016 election campaign. We show that among Republican and Democratic candidates since 1972, and compared to contemporary legislators, citizens have had the most difficulty assessing the ideology of Donald Trump. Our approach is widely applicable to questions concerning public perceptions of politicians’ ideology and the political behavior of citizens and their representatives."
“Spain’s Queen of Soul”: Donna Hightower and Black Women’s Internationalism during the 1960s–1980s,"A growing focus on inequality has given renewed relevance to both Keynesian political economy and its critics on the left. Cowritten by Marxian economists Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy, Monopoly Capital (1966) is one of the most comprehensive—and neglected—left critiques of Keynesianism. Monopoly Capital was written through hundreds of letters exchanged between 1955–64. Though inaccessible to historians for 50 years, this correspondence has recently been made available, and reveals Baran and Sweezy to be both methodologically ecumenical and engaged in the sort of cultural analysis normally associated with the critical theorists whom Perry Anderson and others have labeled “Western Marxists.” In offering an immanent critique of Keynesianism rather than a priori rejecting it for being insufficiently Marxist, Baran and Sweezy reveal a central paradox of the Keynesian vision: that the implementation of liberal-Keynesian economic policies in times of peace is impossible without socialist politics."
"Foucault, Neoliberalism, and Equality","Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent in the Fourth Amendment case Utah v. Strieff (2016) received a great deal of media attention, particularly for its citations to prominent Black political thinkers and its evocations of Black Lives Matter. This article interprets Justice Sotomayor’s dissent as constructing an emergent legal theory that incorporates Black Lives Matter and the experiences of people of color subject to being stopped and searched into the core of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In contrast to Clarence Thomas’s abstracted majority opinion, I argue Sotomayor contests the meaning of the law’s relations to subjects, bringing the feeling, moving, restrained, invaded, prodded, shaped, habitual, racialized subject of the police stop into Supreme Court legal reasoning. In tension with Sotomayor’s phenomenological alternative theory are structural and institutional constraints on the liberatory possibilities for any Supreme Court dissent, particularly one focused on racial injustice. This article argues for recognizing both the generativity of the emergent legal phenomenology and the constraints on its politics in order to grapple with the potential for legal critique to surface from what Sotomayor calls the law’s “cold abstractions.”"
Measuring Public Uncertainty about Candidate Ideology: An Application to US Presidential Elections,"This article excavates a democratic feminist thesis from Susan Okin’s provocative essay, “Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?” by revealing, beneath a conspicuous and troubling “othering” language, an imperative to treat “culture” as a political—as opposed to private—matter and to privilege the voices of women within minority cultures. It thereby locates in Okin’s controversial essay a position against treating liberal principles as trumps over the voices of the most vulnerable, exposing her democratic—as opposed to liberal—leanings and urging contemporary political theorists in a direction that contrasts sharply with Linda Zerilli’s recent calls to outsider liberal judgment. Ultimately, this project invites contemporary political theorists to reconsider the extent to which certain brands of liberalism may be bad for women, and to align instead with 1980s women of color feminism in its emphasis on insider democratic dialogue as a necessary prerequisite to all forms of political judgment."
"A Capital for the Age of Growth: Paul Baran, Paul Sweezy, and the Critique of Keynesian Civilization","We study the relationship between firms’ output quality and organizational structure. Using data on the production and transaction chain that makes up Peruvian fish meal manufacturing, we establish three results. First, firms integrate suppliers when the quality premium rises for exogenous reasons. Second, suppliers change their behavior to better maintain input quality when vertically integrated. Third, firms produce a higher share of high-quality output when weather and supplier availability shocks shift them into using integrated suppliers. Overall, our results indicate that quality upgrading is an important motive for integrating suppliers facing a quantity-quality trade-off, as classical theories of the firm predict."
"Sonia Sotomayor’s Legal Phenomenology, Racial Policing, and the Limits of Law","We aim to devise a Ramsey test analysis of actual causation. Our method is to define a strengthened Ramsey test for causal models. Unlike the accounts of Halpern and Pearl ([2005]) and Halpern ([2015]), the resulting analysis deals satisfactorily with both overdetermination and conjunctive scenarios."
Is Liberalism Bad for Women? Reclaiming Susan Okin’s Democratic Feminist Thesis,"Prepublication peer review should be abolished. We consider the effects that such a change will have on the social structure of science, paying particular attention to the changed incentive structure and the likely effects on the behaviour of individual scientists. We evaluate these changes from the perspective of epistemic consequentialism. We find that where the effects of abolishing prepublication peer review can be evaluated with a reasonable level of confidence based on presently available evidence, they are either positive or neutral. We conclude that on present evidence abolishing peer review weakly dominates the status quo."
"Vertical Integration, Supplier Behavior, and Quality Upgrading among Exporters","This essay reviews three books: The Left Behind: Decline and Rage in Rural America, by Robert Wuthnow; Immigrants, Evangelicals, and Politics in an Era of Demographic Change, by Janelle S. Wong; and The Government-Citizen Disconnect, by Suzanne Mettler. Two common themes are evident. The first is the importance of political polarization and the dominance of race in predicting political views and government’s role in society. The second is distrust of the federal government among conservatives in the United States. Together, these books provide a thorough understanding of the factors associated with this distrust—most notably, partisanship, race, religion, and immigration status. This review brings in other sources to point out that these associations did not happen by accident but were manufactured by conservative political elites. I conclude by considering the consequences of government distrust for democracy in America."
A Ramsey Test Analysis of Causation for Causal Models,"In this essay, I analyze the rise of vengeful populism in relation to sex workers in late twentieth-century Philadelphia as part of the popular response to the transformation in the city’s political economy. I juxtapose vengeful populism with the rage of Donnetta Hill, a Black sex worker tried and convicted for the murder of two men the state alleged were her clients. In order to appreciate the contours of rage as a fiery cascade of affect, emotion, and action in the hands of a Black woman who faced violence, economic depravation, and social ostracization, I draw on Black feminist thought, especially as located in Audre Lorde’s writing, about the generative nature of Black women’s and Black feminist rage. Rage, in the context of Black feminist analysis and in Hill’s actions preceding and after her conviction—which I classify as a spitting rage—signifies a form of power connected to self-preservation and the fierce desire to maintain one’s chosen bonds of family, kin, and community. Rage is thereafter a positive program of self-definition, resistance, and world making. I highlight the contours of Hill’s rage as a generative, if confined and constrained, force over and against the novel enclosures related to the transformation in urban geography, political economy, and politics in the decade and a half between 1980 and 1995. Though Hill’s politics remain largely illegible because of the bloody and vocal expression of her disquiet, I want to appreciate these as abolitionist resources, however constrained and impinged on by the violent context in which Hill attempted to survive and live in the wake of social and economic abandonment."
Is Peer Review a Good Idea?,"This article analyzes the thought of American political writer David Foster Wallace. It argues that Wallace’s primary concern as a political writer was the disappearance of authority in contemporary American life, a condition that should be neither celebrated with postmodern irony nor lamented with reactionary conservatism. Instead, Wallace sought a middle way through the seemingly intractable political and cultural conflict of the late twentieth century. Analyzing four of Wallace’s essays—“E Unibus Pluram,” “Up Simba!,” “Authority and American Usage,” and “Host”—that range in topic from political talk radio to the history of American lexicography, this article focuses on three themes: the consequences of visual spectacle for linguistic communication, the place of doubt and certainty in civic life, and the meaning of democratic authority. The article concludes with an assessment of Wallace’s relevance for the twenty-first century."
The Sources and Consequences of Distrust of Government,"Do party strongholds exacerbate partisan extremism? Using over 140 years of election data and roll call votes I find that, on average, members of Congress elected in states where their party overwhelmingly dominates tend to moderate from their national party’s ideology when compared to members elected in more competitive settings. I argue that heavily one-party states have often been engendered by widespread agreement over locally salient issues, group affect, or imbalanced party organization, not because the electorate consistently agrees with one national party. Consequently, representatives have incentive to run under the dominant party label but must respond to diverse electoral pressures that align to both national parties. While scholars prominently observe one-partyism in the Democratic South, I observe that the plains and rural west, particularly between 1896 and 1932, can be characterized as one-party Republican, too. Perhaps surprisingly, state party strength since the 1990s, in a historical perspective, is quite balanced."
Spitting Back at Law and Order: Donnetta Hill’s Rage in an Era of Vengeance,"This article challenges a common understanding of the role that political disruption plays in promoting large-scale change. It argues that the most basic political work disruption performs is not to win public sympathy but instead to interrupt privileged people’s motivated ignorance. Drawing on examples from the Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter Movements, it makes the case that successful political disruption involves three steps. First, a group of political actors coordinate to withdraw cooperation from an epistemic power relationship, which enables motivated ignorance. Second, this act of epistemic disruption brings latent conflicts to the surface and forces members of dominant groups to take sides. Third, the resulting change in the political agenda enables subordinated actors to negotiate with the politically powerful. The article explains why disruption can be politically effective, even when it fails to win widespread public sympathy."
David Foster Wallace and the Audience of Democratic Authority,"How might discourse generate political change? So far, democratic theorists have focused largely on how deliberative exchanges might shift political opinion. Responding to empirical research that casts doubt on the generalizability of deliberative mechanisms outside of carefully designed forums, this essay seeks to broaden the scope of discourse theory by considering speech that addresses participants’ identities instead. More specifically, we ask what may be learned about identity-oriented discourse by examining the practice of religious preaching. As we demonstrate, scholars of homiletics—the study of preaching—have identified three core features that support its focus on identity: its unconditionality, its appeal to authoritative texts and traditions, and its diffuse instrumentality. We then ask what each of these features might look like in more straightforwardly political contexts. Finally, we address several normative questions raised by this practice, as a way of exploring the promises and dangers accompanying identity-oriented discourse more generally."
"One-Party States and Legislator Extremism in the US House, 1876–2012","When Chinese literary thought is put in a global context, it is often characterized by its disinterest in mimesis and its correlative faith in the legibility of direct lyrical expression, both of which features would derive from a general epistemic optimism common to all schools of Chinese thought. Early writing on music, however, attests to a distrust of the art and to a consequent urge for reform. Suspicious mimesis, linked with the promotion of moral exemplars, is shown in this historical essay to be the ground of aesthetics in the Confucian tradition."
Disruption: What Is It Good For?,"Social scientists are facing a crisis of confidence in quantitative results. Multiverse analysis provides concerned scholars a tool for verifying the robustness of findings. This article introduces political scientists to multiverse analysis through an application. It identifies how differing approaches to data processing led to divergent conclusions about the representation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Americans in Congress in a 2015 Journal of Politics article. The analysis casts doubt on the original conclusion that the size of the LGB population in a district is significantly associated with the bill sponsorship activity of its representative. More broadly, it demonstrates how researchers can keep a running tally of data-processing decisions and parsimoniously present the consequences of those decisions for the findings. Multiverse analysis can help scholars publish replicable results in original work as well as replicate and extend previously published work."
Preaching to the Choir? Rhetoric and Identity in a Polarized Age,"This article uses detailed, transaction-level data on candidate disbursements and panel survey data to estimate the effect of candidate spending. Transaction-level data allow me to isolate only spending that is being used on messages to voters, while panel survey data enable me to control for unobserved candidate characteristics. I find that spending on messages to voters has a statistically significant effect on voter support for candidates. Spending is especially effective in changing the composition of voters, instead of convincing potential voters to switch their vote. Not all voters are equally affected by spending; low-information voters, members of a political party and the economically dissatisfied respond strongly to candidate spending. Finally, I provide evidence that the most commonly used measure of candidate spending overestimates the amount of money that candidates use on their own campaigns, and regressions using this measure are less likely to find a statistically significant effect of spending."
Music and Evil: A Basis of Aesthetics in China,"A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from government discretionary spending increase their electoral support for the incumbent party. But, contrary to theories of political accountability, some suggest that voters also reward incumbent parties for “programmatic” spending, over which incumbents have no discretion, even when passed with support from all major parties. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority parties would support legislation that costs them votes. We study two prominent programmatic policies. For the first, we design and implement one of the largest randomized social experiments ever. For the second, we reanalyze studies that came to opposite conclusions, using a large-scale randomized experiment and a natural experiment. By improving statistical methods and correcting data errors, we show that evidence from all analyses of both policies is consistent: programmatic policies have no measurable effect on voter support for incumbents."
"Reevaluating the Substantive Representation of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Americans: A Multiverse Analysis","Existing studies show that party alignment between national and subnational politicians has a positive impact on government spending. However, public programs often need the approval or input from career bureaucrats. Since party politics do not directly affect these agents’ incentives, it is unclear whether party alignment will affect their performance and the programs they supervise. To examine this question, I rely on a uniquely large and granular data set of projects implemented under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme in India. The evidence shows that party alignment leads to lower project approval time and a higher utilization of program resources without compromising the overall quality of projects. Career concerns emerge, over political selection, as an important mechanism explaining bureaucratic behavior. The overall findings suggest that bureaucrats’ incentives combined with the structure of promotions in the civil service are important factors explaining the impact of party alignment on the distribution of resources."
Does Campaign Spending Affect Election Outcomes? New Evidence from Transaction-Level Disbursement Data,"We model household choice of schools under the Boston mechanism (BM) and develop a new method, applicable to a broad class of mechanisms, to fully solve the choice problem even if it is infeasible via the traditional method. We estimate the joint distribution of household preferences and sophistication types, using administrative data from Barcelona. Counterfactual policy analyses show that a change from BM in Barcelona to the deferred-acceptance mechanism would decrease average welfare by €1,020, while a change to the top-trading-cycles mechanism would increase average welfare by €460."
Do Nonpartisan Programmatic Policies Have Partisan Electoral Effects? Evidence from Two Large-Scale Experiments,"The current research examines how the influence of fake news on product evaluations is moderated by consumers’ political ideologies. Several experiments show that exposure to fake news undermines the evaluations that liberals (but not conservatives) form in response to offerings they subsequently encounter in contexts completely unrelated to the fake news. Mediational evidence is also provided, indicating that exposure to fake news makes liberal consumers mistrust the news source; this mistrust impairs the level of trust they place in firms offering a product/service, which in turn reduces their evaluations of that offering. Collectively, these findings document the ability of fake news to instigate a generalized mistrust in sources (i.e., a “mistrust mind-set”) among liberal consumers that influences their subsequent evaluations of products and services in the marketplace."
Loyalty or Incentives? How Party Alignment Affects Bureaucratic Performance,"Common political economy models point to rationalist motives for engaging in conflict but say little about how income shocks translate into collective violence in some cases but not in others. Grievance models, in contrast, focus on structural origins of shared frustration but offer less insight into when the deprived decide to challenge the status quo. Addressing these lacunae, we develop a theoretical model of civil conflict that predicts income loss to trigger violent mobilization primarily when the shock can be linked to preexisting collective grievances. The conditional argument is supported by results of a comprehensive global statistical analysis of conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Consistent with theory, we find that this relationship is most powerful among recently downgraded groups, especially in the context of agricultural dependence and low local level of development, whereas political downgrading in the absence of adverse economic changes exerts less influence on ethnic conflict risk."
Structural Estimation of a Model of School Choices: The Boston Mechanism versus Its Alternatives,"In 1967 Guy Debord published the pamphlet-sized The Society of the Spectacle, a book written in the form of a collection of short theses. Debord was criticized for inventing the “spectacle” out of thin air by thinkers of his time such as Michel Foucault. We can, however, detect salient manifestations of the Debordian spectacular society in China of the 2010s. This paper demonstrates a deep and pervasive trend of spectacularization in China by analyzing (a) Taobao as a desire-creating machine producing the buy-buy-buy fanaticism, (b) the beautifying operation that has engendered perverted effects in sexual relationship, (c) the spectacular dialectic epitomized by the celebrity culture, and (d) the reality-twisting effects of the spectacles. The paper further offers a comparative analysis of the contemporary spectacles vis-à-vis the Maoist spectacles of the 1960s, which sheds light in understanding the enactment of antientertainment actions in recent years. The spectacles in contemporary China, in the fashion depicted by Debord half a century ago, have effectively produced a specific worldview of commodity and consumption, and this worldview transforms itself, through blind trust, into a type of objective force. The social terrains needed for spreading and cultivating socialist values were heavily colonized by the such spectacles (consumption, beautification, celebrity culture, entertainment); the latter have significantly absorbed the masses’ attention in the last decade to such level that it has almost occupied all spaces for communication and played the leading role in regulating people’s daily lives. The “Beauty is justice!” slogan that has been extremely popular in contemporary China reveals one significant change in Chinese culture and its sociopolitical effect: the trend of spectacularization, through elevating spectacle to the supreme value and turning the country into a spectacular (un)reality, has not only homogenized China but also effectively depoliticized the country."
"A World of Mistrust: Fake News, Mistrust Mind-Sets, and Product Evaluations","Weber defined the state as having a monopoly on violence. Theories of policing that rely on his definition conceptualize police as technicians of sovereign violence. This marginalizes the nonviolent dimension of policing and occludes the broader spectrum of ways in which modern political life is implicated in police powers. I propose to expand theoretical engagement with policing beyond a narrow focus on sovereign violence to a broadly “performative” understanding of police power grounded in anthropological theories of ritual. Through a case study of the relationship between a group of Taiwanese police and a locally powerful union, I illuminate the dynamics by which violence, politics, and policing are connected in a Taiwanese city. How do police who lack the capacity to impose order by force effectively keep the peace? I answer this question by reference to my observation of a tense but nonviolent encounter between police and union members. By contextualizing this interaction in its cultural and historical conditions of possibility, I show how Taiwanese democracy has taken root in a polytheist political theology. This illustrates how the weakness of police power can be treated as an index for the strength of democratic values institutionalized in the wider political environment."
A Conditional Model of Local Income Shock and Civil Conflict,"The recent, crisp articulation of “nonintrinsic egalitarianism” emerged out of the critique of the influential distinction between “telic’’ and “deontic” egalitarianisms. Part of the promise of this approach is that it can be deployed in order to reintegrate these recent philosophical debates about equality with much older currents in the history of political thought. The article explains how the century of argument in England and France after 1650 created the intellectual space for the kind of presentation of nonintrinsic egalitarian ideas such as we find in Rousseau’s major political writings from the 1750s onward. In so doing, the article illustrates the striking extent to which fundamental political-theoretical disagreements are often driven not so much by competing normative commitments as by divergent understandings of how those commitments ramify through the sociological and institutional possibilities that disputants imagine are plausibly open to them."
The Rivalry of Spectacle: A Debordian-Lacanian Analysis of Contemporary Chinese Culture,"Politics is about power, contestation, and negotiation. Political discourse relies not only on the persuasiveness of words, rational argumentation, and ethical appeals but also on the deployment of images. Political disputes around abortion are paradigmatic of the crucial role that images can play. While conservative groups have deployed powerful imagery to present their moral and political convictions, abortion rights organizations are increasingly intervening in the political arena with visual artifacts. Places where abortion is illegal and where activists have been struggling to repeal punitive abortion laws seem particularly well suited for examining the visual repertoires of abortion rights activists. Argentina is a case in point. This article interrogates the visual production of three significant organizations for abortion rights in Argentina: the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortion; Lesbians and Feminists for the Decriminalization of Abortion; and the Network of Socorristas (first responders). What kinds of images, symbols, and aesthetic strategies have they crafted? What meanings do these visuals convey? What affects do they mobilize? How do these images fit, contradict, or exceed vital dimensions of Argentina’s political culture? We examine abortion rights images along three lines: first, the meaning of key symbols of the organizations; second, emerging notions of abortion safety; and finally, the struggle for abortion rights in relation to human rights, citizenship, and democracy. We consider the potency and limitations of the organizations’ visuals, contributing an analysis of local experiences in relation to abortion rights activism as a topic of transnational relevance."
"Weak Police, Strong Democracy: Civic Ritual and Performative Peace in Contemporary Taiwan","This article tracks the evolution of the understanding of infant mortality and of policies aimed at reducing it in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany between 1949 and 1990. East Germany and West Germany diverged widely in their understanding of the social significance of infant mortality from the postwar years into the 1960s. Around 1965, the gap in the level and type of attention paid to infant mortality began to narrow. By 1975, the fight to reduce infant mortality in East and West Germany was fundamentally similar in discourse, methods, and aims. Discourse and policy converged, this article argues, on a regime of liberal governance of pregnancy and childbirth. The article explores how and why confluence occurred despite the two states’ extremely different health systems and antithetical political and economic systems. Convergence in the East and in the West, the article contends, emerged out of the interacting influences on both German states of international trends, domestic politics, and transnational exchange."
"Nonintrinsic Egalitarianism, from Hobbes to Rousseau","Diversity in the characteristics of political leaders increases the quality of policy, perceptions of legitimacy, and accountability to constituents. Yet, increasing leaders’ diversity proves one of the most difficult challenges facing modern democracy. Efforts like gender quotas shift descriptive representation on the targeted characteristic, but critics argue that women selected via quotas are as homogenous as those selected via traditional methods. In this article, we theorize that quotas (re)conceptualize views of potential political leaders and transform party recruitment networks. In doing so, quotas increase the diversity of all leaders in office. We evaluate these claims with a new measure of diversity and a data set of over 1,700 legislators in Argentinian subnational government. We show that quotas increase the professional and personal diversity of women and men in office over time, suggesting that electoral gender quotas transform parties, political networks, and how women (and men) perceive political office."
Abortion Rights in Images: Visual Interventions by Activist Organizations in Argentina,"Education researchers and political scientists have long raised theoretical objections to market-based reforms like school choice on the grounds that these policies may undermine public participation in democratic politics and erode public support for public institutions like schools. Little work, however, has empirically tested this claim. Drawing on a unique dataset of 191 off-cycle school bond elections in Michigan school districts between 2005 and 2017, this paper employs regression modeling to test whether voter turnout and school bond passage rates are lower in districts where school choice exit participation is high. Results show that a 1 percentage point increase in a district’s school choice participation rate is associated with a 1% decline in voter turnout in that district’s school bond elections. This result is statistically significant even when controlling for other community and election characteristics associated with voter turnout. However, differential relationships are revealed for exit via charter schools and exit via interdistrict public school choice. The data do not reveal a significant relationship between school choice and the odds of bond passage on election day."
The Fight against Infant Mortality in Cold War Germany: East/West Convergence on Liberal Governmentality,"It is now well established that states and localities differ substantially in their policies and that these differences are associated with differences in public opinion. However, this fact is puzzling. People are mostly ignorant of state and local government, and state and local elections appear increasingly linked to their federal counterparts, despite very different candidates and policy stakes. The leading solution to this puzzle is the partisan accountability theory of Erikson, Wright, and McIver. However, this explanation does not fit neatly with the recent literature. I show that ideological divisions in state-level elections fit poorly with the theory as well. New theoretical developments are needed to address this puzzle. I suggest two directions that this could take."
"Gender Quotas, Women’s Representation, and Legislative Diversity","This article examines Ralph Ellison’s understanding of democratic leadership and its relationship to freedom in Invisible Man. The theory of democratic leadership that emerges from the novel consists of three elements. First, because they recognize that ordinary people are capable of political action, democratic leaders seek to ensure that their fellow citizens can gain political freedom by becoming visible political actors with an equal voice. Democratic leaders do not manipulate or dominate, but rather try to ensure that the political capacities of their followers are cultivated, so that they, too, can be seen and heard. Second, instead of seeking to advance their own predetermined goals, democratic leaders seek to advance goals that they have in common with their fellow citizens. Third, democratic leaders strive to reaffirm and reapply what Ellison called “the principle on which the country was built” in order to move the citizenry further toward “the democratic ideal.”"
"Trading Off Democracy? School Choice, Voter Turnout, and School Bond Election Outcomes","Voter education campaigns often aim to increase voter participation and political accountability. Randomized interventions were implemented nationwide during the 2009 Mozambican elections using leaflets, text messaging, and a free newspaper. We study the local peer effects triggered by the campaign. We investigate whether treatment effects are transmitted through social networks and geographical proximity at the village level. For individuals personally targeted by the campaign, we estimate the reinforcement effect of proximity to other individuals in our sample. For untargeted individuals, we estimate how the campaign diffuses as a function of proximity to others in the sample. We find evidence for both effects that are similar across treatments and proximity measures. The campaign raises the level of interest in the election through networks, in line with the average treatment effect. However, we find a negative network effect of the treatment on voter participation, implying that the positive effect of treatment on more central individuals is smaller. We interpret this result as consistent with free riding through pivotal reasoning and provide additional evidence to support this claim."
Why Are Subnational Governments Responsive?,"Recent studies of peacebuilding highlight the importance of attending to people’s local experiences of conflict and cooperation. This trend, however, raises the fundamental questions of how the local is and should be constituted and what the relationship is between institutions and individual actors of peace at the local level of politics. I turn to Hannah Arendt’s thoughts to address these issues. Arendt’s thinking provides a distinctive form of realism that calls for stable institutions but never depletes the spirit of resistance. Peacebuilding guided by this insight seeks to enable parties in conflict to voice their competing opinions by acting agonistically in public and to help them align their disruptive yet creative voices with a desire to establish and sustain common institutions. Thus, Arendt’s thinking not only offers a way to increase sensitivity to local differences but also to provide direction to the politics of resistance. In the end, it offers a balanced insight into peacebuilding and local agency beyond the contemporary liberal and critical approaches to peace."
Invisible Man and Democratic Leadership,"Academic trends and developments in the research field have profoundly affected my choice of research topics. When I conducted field research for an anthropology PhD in Iran from June 1978 to December 1979, academic interests at the time and the revolutionary upheaval in Iran channeled my work. I focused on “Aliabad” villagers’ political culture, including women’s activities and marriage ties, and how their political culture influenced their views, analyses, and participation in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Currently, academic foci include marriage and sexuality, and a sexual revolution is spreading in Iran. Impacted by these developments, both women in Iran, especially younger ones, and I are more open to breaking previous silences and discussing sexuality. Guided by other researchers, media, local preoccupations, and research partners, I will investigate the current revolution: the dramatic transformations in Iranian gender politics, sexuality, and marriage relations, beginning to spread, even to the community of Aliabad (a pseudonym)."
Voting and Peer Effects: Experimental Evidence from Mozambique,"Testing rationality of decision-making and choice by evaluating the mathematical property of transitivity has a long tradition in biology, economics, psychology, and zoology. This paradigm is fraught with conceptual, mathematical, and statistical pitfalls. In this overview, we tackle five major obstacles. One challenge lies in spelling out what transitivity of latent preferences really says and what it actually implies about observable choice behavior. Most notably, this step is fraught with aggregation artifacts, in that aggregated behavior can be profoundly misleading about individual behavior. Another hurdle comes from hard mathematical problems associated with characterizing the properties of heterogeneous transitive populations. A third challenge is the prevalence of straw man hypotheses in this area of research. The fourth difficulty is associated with adopting appropriate statistical inference tools that correctly accommodate the idiosyncratic mathematical properties of order-constrained statistical hypotheses. The fifth hurdle arises with the role of scientific parsimony in rationality research. We walk readers through key concepts, mathematical models, and statistical techniques for testing rationality. Throughout, we provide examples using the methods and data of two prominent published papers on animal choice behavior as our case studies. We explain how these papers tackled the five hurdles to varying degrees of success."
Building Communities of Peace: Arendtian Realism and Peacebuilding,"This article queries the politics of writing about early modern connectivity today. Set against the combined backdrop of the global history boom of the past two decades and the recently emerging criticisms of its overemphasis on connectivity, it encourages political, cultural, and literary historians to ask questions about how we frame stories of cross-cultural encounter. The first part of the article calls for a vigorous enquiry into how exactly connections worked and failed to work, suggesting an explicit engagement with the notion of (dis)connectivity. Understanding and theorizing the breakdown of communications and the multiple ways in which cross-cultural communication could lead to conquest and colonial domination is central to this endeavor. In the second part of the article, I suggest that we sharpen our awareness of the methodological and ethical challenges inherent to our selecting of stories of (dis)connectivity from the historical record. Touching upon the current debate about sources and voices in Native American and Indigenous studies, I advocate for a hospitable accommodation of multiple narratives about early modern (dis)connections as historians of global early modernity seek not only to be heard by audiences across the globe, but engage with them in ethically sustainable intellectual exchanges. This article thus offers a constructive critique of the “connected history” paradigm in an attempt to improve its productivity and potential for debate."
Field Research in a Revolutionary Setting: Overlooking Sexuality in 1978–1979 Iran,"Little remembered today, James W. Sullivan wrote the book that, more than any other, catalyzed the initiative and referendum movement in the United States. Crucial to the success of Sullivan’s Direct Legislation by the Citizenship through the Initiative and Referendum was his immersion in the labor radicalism of New York City in the 1880s, including as editor of the Boycotter and Union Printer and labor editor of Henry George’s Standard. Especially important in honing and publicizing his ideas was his tenure at the radical weekly Twentieth Century between 1889 and 1892. Forged in the bitter political and ideological conflicts, setbacks, and disappointments of the late 1880s, Direct Legislation showed “the radical world” a way to sidestep doctrinal fights about political economy and focus instead on knitting together a broad “opportunistic” coalition of labor and middle-class reformers with the power to remake political institutions."
(Ir)rationality of animal choice? A guide to testing transitivity,"How do newly enfranchised groups achieve representation of shared interests? I theorize that while suffrage expansion has the potential to sway electoral tides in favor of the newly enfranchised, such effects are conditional on the strength of a social movement that seeks to represent the group. A social movement defines the group’s shared interests and creates a mobilized pool of voters who can take electoral action to foster common goals. In testing this argument, I use evidence from the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in the United States. I employ a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the heterogeneity in the proportion of women across counties to estimate preferences of women voters and show that these preferences vary with the strength of the suffrage movement. These findings highlight that de jure inclusion of a previously disenfranchised group may not be sufficient to secure de facto representation of the group’s shared interests."
(Dis)connected History and the Multiple Narratives of Global Early Modernity,"Terrain is central to understanding why some countries experience contentious ethnic divisions and civil war. While existing research specifies a direct effect of rugged terrain on civil war (i.e., it impedes state efforts to counter rebellion), we argue that terrain has an overlooked indirect effect on civil war via its historical influence on the distribution and political status of ethnic groups. We argue that access to variable rugged terrain facilitated the development and survival of more distinct ethnic groups by both restricting interaction among communities in rugged areas and complicating state repression. Both arguments suggest that groups in rugged areas face greater risk of political marginalization. Using geocoded data on civil war, terrain, and the distribution and political status of ethnic groups, we demonstrate that up to 40% of rugged terrain’s effects on civil war are mediated by its indirect effect on the exclusion of politically relevant ethnic groups."
The Opportunist: James W. Sullivan and the Origins of the Initiative and Referendum in the United States,"Political scientists have long been interested in how “gendered institutions”—institutions for which gender at least partially affects outcomes—operate in the political arena. Yet we know relatively little about how our discipline’s own institutions might be gendered. In the current project, we examine how gender operates within the institution of the journal review process. We implement a unique double-blind experiment embedded in the review process at a real academic journal in which the editor encourages a randomly selected subset of reviewers to provide additional citations, including citations to their own work. The nudge did not increase the probability that a reviewer would cite a woman, but it did increase the number of women cited given that the reviewer cited at least one woman, an expected increase of 0.05 citations to women per review. Furthermore, the nudge actually exacerbated the self-citation gender gap."
The Electoral Impact of Newly Enfranchised Groups: The Case of Women’s Suffrage in the United States,"Accent bias, namely, an unwarranted prejudice toward interlocutors based on the sound of their speech, is a subtle yet powerful feature in the political life of language. This is especially so in democratic polities characterized by a diverse soundscape. The powerful and often covert nature of accent bias, and its capacity to generate significant epistemic injustice, poses a critical challenge to democratic theory and praxis, by challenging its commitment to liberty, equality, inclusivity, and reciprocity, and the very process of democratic reasoning. This article offers a comprehensive and empirically supported analysis of the political life of accent and advocates the cultivation of a sense of metalinguistic awareness among political actors, professional and otherwise, in order to counter the considerable risk of accent bias in democratic life. This cultivation draws on a conception of language that is socially embedded and dialogic and that can contribute to a more informed democratic theory of language."
"Places to Hide: Terrain, Ethnicity, and Civil Conflict","After democratic transitions, many Eastern European countries reformed their political institutions in a piecemeal fashion. Focusing on the Bulgarian Constitutional Court from 1992 to 2012 and the Soviet-style procurator general, we analyze how legal reforms operate in practice in transitional societies. Using original data, we find that judges are influenced by the powerful and unaccountable procurator general. Judges’ decisions to strike down laws also are guided by alignment with their or their appointers’ political preferences and the opinions of interested parties in amicus briefs. The study has implications about interbranch relations and the role of procurator generals in constitutional review."
The Review Process and the Citation Gap: The Role of the Editor’s Nudge,"The literature on bureaucratic capacity and autonomy in American political development is focused on federal agencies, with little attention paid to the development of subnational bureaucracies whose leaders are elected. I argue that while the “policrats” who lead such agencies value their status as elected officials, it also makes them vulnerable to the charge of being mere political hacks. Using the example of district attorneys, I argue that the rise of the administrative state enhanced the potency of this threat, so that policrats increasingly had to harmonize their classic electoral, credit-claiming activity with the work of building the reputations of their bureaucracies. One solution was to create professional organizations and claim they had expertise, authority, and standards analogous to those of the traditional professions, such as medicine or the law. Critically, this expertise was claimed to incorporate a “commonsense” mentality compatible with popular election. Thus, subnational actors borrowed core tactics and ideas of national statebuilding to entrench the fragmented “old American state” and layer it with new coercive powers."
Sound Reasoning: Why Accent Bias Matters for Democratic Theory,"This article is an effort to register the archival surge among Palestinians in Palestine and beyond. It is focused not on the collection of archives but on the mulitmedia practice of archiving as political practice. It is not the work in and on archives that redefines the terms of engagement but the practice of archiving itself. The challenge is directed at what constitutes custodial control, access, rubrics of order, and a pedagogy of use. Academics, artists, and activists are challenging the aesthetics of dissent and the work of aesthetics in redefining what constitutes the political in oppressive colonial regimes today. Countermovements of documentation are efforts to displace rather than only disprove colonial truth. The conceits of what counts as archival labor—and who can do it—are poised to implode."
The Influence of Procurator Generals in Constitutional Review: The Case of Bulgaria,"Contrary to the view that inequality reduces turnout, political participation among low-income voters is higher in democracies with high levels of inequality and intermediate levels of state capacity. We address this puzzle by analyzing the link between political mobilization and spending decisions at different levels of inequality and state capacity. Under high inequality and low levels of capacity, parties find it optimal to mobilize low-income voters via targeted goods. Yet, as capacity increases, targeted mobilization becomes a less effective strategy for voters’ mobilization. To evaluate the implications of this argument we exploit a quasi-natural experiment, the anticorruption audits by the Brazilian government. We show that an exogenous increase in monitoring effort by the state breaks the equilibrium around high participation of the poor and leads to a reduction in turnout, a reduction in the provision of targeted goods, and a decline in the likelihood of reelection by incumbents."
"Iron Cages and Ballot Boxes: Prosecutors, Elections, and Subnational Statebuilding","How does conflict affect firms’ investment decisions? Past results are mixed: a third of the studies we reviewed report null or mixed correlations; some suggest that conflict increases investment. We rationalize these results, arguing that armed conflict has divergent effects depending on firms’ exposure to violence. Conflict can deter investment by disrupting production or raising uncertainty. Yet, conflict can encourage investment by hampering government oversight. We argue that each mechanism operates over different geographic extents. We use data from the mining sector to test these claims and report three main results. Firms operating at conflict sites dramatically reduce investments. By contrast, firms operating in territory surrounding conflict, but separated from fighting, actually increase investment. Firms far from violence see a small negative effect. These divergent responses cannot be inferred from aggregate flows: we show that conflict depresses aggregate investment, but this reflects responses among firms far from fighting."
Archiving Praxis: For Palestine and Beyond,"There has been an uptick in attention paid to institutional questions in ideal theory. The fundamental question concerns whether the ideal social world would include a state. The answer turns on how one models the ideal social world. I identify three parameters of such a model and show that there is no a priori answer to the aforementioned question. It depends, in part, on whether there exist political disputes—or “friction”—between the agents in the model. What generates this friction? Pace a series of recent arguments that suggest the generation of political friction comes from the presence of injustice, I argue that it is actually political diversity or pluralism that produces the types of disagreements relevant to the justification of the state. Injustice is merely one potential source of disagreement and only generates “friction” when there are also just agents in the model."
"Democracy under High Inequality: Capacity, Spending, and Participation","The confluence of illegality, counterinsurgency, and marginality in Colombia has led to the militarization of social life, national politics, policy making, and state practices in peripheral areas. The state has sought not only to conquer and recover territories from the guerrillas but also to reunify the nation, designating the army to achieve this goal. The Plan for Territorial Consolidation promoted a civil-military governance model to bring the state and provide security to these recovered territories by any means necessary, including the use of clowns. I argue that the peace agreement signed in November 2016—after 53 years of armed conflict—is challenging the long-term militarization policy subsumed under a counterinsurgency strategy. Instead, it provides a context for seeing the inhabitants of areas in conflict as citizens rather than guerrilla auxiliaries and makes marginal territories and their populations central to achieving peace. Former guerrilla combatants in Transitory Rural Normalization Zones established in these peripheral areas seek to work with government officials to implement social, political, and economic projects for both demobilized fighters and the communities with which they have shared territory for decades. Nevertheless, the specters of the Cold War and the dirty war haunt these areas as community leaders continue to be assassinated."
Bolshevik Bargaining in Soviet Industry: Communists between State and Society in the Interwar Soviet Union,"This article examines a little-studied aspect of the Soviet Union’s history, namely, the activities of the mass membership of the Communist Party during the interwar period. Based on original archival research, it offers a microhistorical view of an industrial primary party organization (PPO) of the Communist Party during some of the most critical moments of Soviet history, including the first Five Year Plan and the repressions of the late 1930s. It shows that all major political initiatives of the leadership generated intense political activity at the bottom levels of the party hierarchy, as the rank-and-file members interpreted and acted on central directives in ways that were in line with their and their colleagues’ interests. As these interests were hardly ever in harmony with those of the state apparatus, the result was a permanent state of tension between the executive and political branches of the Soviet party-state. The main argument offered is that, ultimately, PPOs were an extremely important but contradictory element of the Soviet political system, being a reliable constituency of grassroots support while at the same time placing significant limits on the ability of state organs to implement policy. In addition to contributing to the specialized literature on Soviet industrial relations, this article offers novel insight into the classic totalitarian/revisionist debates by identifying a level of the Soviet system where the line between society and the state became blurred and where grassroots agency became possible on the basis of a minimum level of active support for the state."
"Joshua Kotin, Utopias of One","Following armed conflict, voters must often evaluate candidates who have allegedly committed violence against civilians. What kinds of alleged perpetrators are voters more willing to support and why? I argue that people appraise candidates’ alleged involvement in violence by considering how their participation reflects competence and integrity. This article relies on the theory of dyadic morality to build a framework for civilian judgements about perpetrator integrity. The article also argues that the most salient form of competence in the context of civilian targeting is security competence. A conjoint survey in Colombia featuring hypothetical former combatants running for office indicates, in line with my argument, that attributes associated with integrity affect respondent preferences. Respondents are more supportive of candidates who violate less strict norms, have less agency, and have less clear causal links to the victims. More unexpectedly, attributes associated with security competence are less important than broader indicators of competence."
Evaluations of Violence at the Polls: Civilian Victimization and Support for Perpetrators after War,"Notions of momentum loom large in accounts of presidential primaries despite imprecision about its meaning and measurement. Defining momentum as the impact election outcomes have on candidate support above and beyond existing trends and leveraging a rolling cross section of more than 325,000 interviews to examine daily changes in candidate support in the 2016 nomination contests reveal scant evidence that primary election outcomes uniquely affect respondents’ preferences over the competing candidates. Preferences sometimes respond to election outcomes, but the estimated effects are indistinguishable from effects occurring on nonelection days. There is also no evidence that those who should be most receptive to new information are more affected by election outcomes. As a result, our investigation strongly suggests that election outcomes are not uniquely important for affecting opinions and shaping the outcome of nomination contests."
Knockout Blows or the Status Quo? Momentum in the 2016 Primaries,"Ten years after the popular uprising that became a brutal war, Syrian and Syrian-Palestinian authors are engaged in the struggle to craft a historical consciousness that can acknowledge and mourn for their recent revolutionary past without reifying it. As they write in and of material, political, and social ruin, their works echo collective traumas in regional memory: the Palestinian nakba, the rise of Syria’s Assad regime, Lebanon’s civil war, the 2003 occupation of Iraq, and more. The ruin appears cruelly recursive, yet it is arrested in the corpus of works discussed in this article: poetry by Firas Sulaiman and Osama Esber; prose by Yassin al-Haj Saleh, Samer Yazbek, and Ra’id Wahsh; and documentary film by the Abounaddara Collective. Drawing on Arabic poetic modernism and regional politics, I argue that ruin imagery—ranging from war’s rubble to ancient artefacts—carries distinctive structures of temporal anticipation in Syrian literary and cultural memory. The writers and filmmakers discussed deploy formal and thematic means of stasis and repetition, displacement and accumulation, to summon these temporal structures—only to refuse, interrupt, and reroute them. I argue that such poetic engineerings of the images of ruin assert the singularity of the Syrian present within broader collective memories of ruin. As such, they raise a historicizing challenge to the current academic dominance of reading ruin imagery, notably from the Middle East, through an imperial lens."
"On the Ruins of What’s to Come, I Stand: Time and Devastation in Syrian Cultural Production since 2011","More individuals in the United States identify as evangelical than any other religious group, yet we have sparse empirical data on the gendered and sexual practices and understandings within this population. Attending to evangelical constructions of gender and sexuality can tell us quite a bit about the cultural and political agendas at the fore of American life. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, this article critically investigates contemporary evangelical responses to feminism. I argue that the church grapples with changes in understandings of gender and sexuality against the backdrop of what I call an “imagined secular world.” Evangelicals evoke the imagined secular in their debates about gender and sexuality in the church today as a way of defining their own contemporary religious identities. This article details the construction of the imagined secular through three evangelical responses to feminism: constructions of an evangelical feminism, seeking a middle ground, and rejecting feminism. I argue that the church creates space for and encourages a type of messiness that allows for these varied responses to feminist beliefs but that these varied responses all seem to suggest that evangelicals are not very willing to budge when it comes to gendered change. I suggest that feminist scholars must recognize this messiness to understand the modern religious Right, as evangelical understandings about sex and families have shaped a political movement that has remade the Republican Party and transformed American politics."
Contemporary Evangelical Responses to Feminism and the Imagined Secular,"AbstractResponding to the social, political, economic, and ecological challenges that confront contemporary society, this article—the 2019 Presidential Address to the American Society for Environmental History—argues that critique and resistance, married with a quest for alternative possibilities, will serve us better than a doleful narrative of decline. It seeks hope by reengaging with the ideas of scholars who earlier lamented despoliation and envisaged other, better, ways of being in the world. By discovering, interrogating, and drawing insight from the ways in which our precursors sought to emancipate their contemporaries, we can ask what they (or their ideas) can do for us. Although this strategy is unlikely to deliver immediate efficacious solutions to current dilemmas, it can help us to historicize ourselves and the precepts that shape our lives. It can also expand the range of existential possibilities by calling into question the conceited convictions, tired mantras, and blithe assumptions of contemporary economic and political discourse. By reflecting on the lives and contributions of two Canadians—Pierre Dansereau, an ecologist, and C. B. Macpherson, a political theorist—whose ideas cast light on the roots of our present predicament, this article helps to frame hopeful strategies with which to address our circumstances."
Framing an Ecology of Hope,"The human condition is an ineluctably temporal condition, and yet political theory has rarely and indirectly grappled with concepts, practices, and problems regarding time. Two notable recent exceptions are books by Julie L. Rose and Nichole Marie Shippen, both of which argue that free or discretionary time ought to be included in political considerations of justice. While their respective projects are valuable in themselves, their limitations also provide valuable illustrations of several fundamental problems that any political treatment of time must eventually consider. Drawing upon work on time from elsewhere in the social sciences and humanities, this essay critically examines three aspects of Rose’s and Shippen’s projects: 1) their unquestioning embrace of clock-time; 2) their neglect of phenomena of social acceleration; and 3) their attempts to secure greater individual autonomy through temporal practices that are essentially disciplinary in nature. While the “fight for (free) time” is indeed worth waging, doing so successfully requires a deliberate pluralism that acknowledges concepts and practices of time beyond the hegemony of the clock and calendar."
The Fight for (Free) Time,"This review essay considers the question of authority and authorization in contemporary black political culture in light of two recent books, Begin Again: James Baldwin’s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own by Eddie S. Glaude Jr. and Afropessimism by Frank B. Wilderson III."
Who Decides What We Do with Our Despair?,"Debates in political theory about national borders and free movement tend to focus on the abstract, static question of how much openness is ethically appropriate. In practice, however, any long-term realization of freer movement globally is likely to involve a dynamic patchwork of experiments that face setbacks from time to time. As Brexit revealed, a free movement zone can sometimes be broken up by a backlash to reclaim control of borders. In the world of policy and international law, there is some grudging respect for the acquired rights of individuals who have already moved across borders. But politicians and scholars fail to give enough weight to the expectation of many European Union citizens that the free movement zone would remain open to them. This article puts forth the view that a state’s right to self-determination does not legitimately extend to closing borders, if openness has already been consolidated as an expectation and a social fact. It suggests that a proper account of cross-border social goods will chasten the undue deference given to the political sphere in curtailing openness. This argument has vital implications for migration policy in coming decades, offering normative clarity on why it would be improper to roll back free movement once achieved."
When Open Borders Must Stay Open: Expectations and Freedom of Movement,"A major player in the political economy of pharmaceuticals in the Global South, and boasting a universal health care system, Brazil offers fertile ground for exploring the unanticipated ways people have mobilized for treatment access in contexts of stark inequality. In this article, I place the ever-evolving twin phenomena of the pharmaceuticalization and judicialization of health in a multilayered historical context: the post–World War II push for states to embrace the idea that their citizenry had a right to health, and Brazil’s particular embrace of a constitutional right to health in 1988; the turn of the World Health Organization (WHO) to essential medicines in the 1970s, and the responses of both governments and pharmaceutical companies in the ensuing decades; the advent of neoliberal forces as they swept the globe, landing in Brazil in the early 1990s; and the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Brazil with the government’s precedent-setting provision of lifesaving antiretroviral therapies in the late 1990s. This dynamic context sheds light on a bottom-up ethnographic inquiry of the ways the poor in Brazil have turned in increasing numbers over the last two decades to the courts to litigate access to medicines. Through their collective trust in the judiciary and their willingness to be a frontline force against the ill effects of neoliberalism, citizen-litigants are instantiating a kind of magical legalism, opening up new possibilities for the state to live up to its human rights and medical commitments. People’s quests for accountability reveal an ambitious vision of justice at a local scale and a distinct sense of politics in-the-making, even alongside a resurgent authoritarianism."
"Thomas Waugh, The Conscience of Cinema: The Works of Joris Ivens 1912–1989","As economic inequality increases, so does the importance of understanding affluent perspectives on the problem. We examine whether affluent Americans are more likely than others to hold individuals responsible for relative success in life and whether such beliefs are associated with their economic policy attitudes. We conducted a novel survey that oversampled the top 5% of the US income and wealth distributions. We elicited views about dispositional (intelligence, hard work) and situational (family, luck) causes of success as well as explanations for why success-linked traits vary (people’s choices, environments, genes). Affluent Americans were more likely than others to emphasize dispositional reasons for getting ahead, and the top 1% were unique in emphasizing both choices and genes as causes of those traits. This individualization of economic outcomes was more strongly associated with economic conservatism among the affluent than others, suggesting it may play a role in justifying their greater conservatism."
"Gina Miller, Rise: Life Lessons in Speaking Out, Standing Tall and Leading the Way","This is a reconstruction of John H. Schaar’s first introductory lecture for his course on American political thought taught often at University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Santa Cruz. Schaar argues that America had two foundings: the communitarian experiment of the New England Puritans and that of the American Revolution and Constitution of 1789, which were rooted in liberal political theory. While the first founding has been forgotten, even reviled, the second founding led to corruption, violence, individualism, and privatism. Schaar calls for the restoration of participatory community while recognizing the formidable obstacles to accomplishing that."
The Pharmaceuticalization and Judicialization of Health: On the Interface of Medical Capitalism and Magical Legalism in Brazil,"Why are the fastest growing countries predominantly autocracies? One possible reason is that growth “tigers” are poor countries that begin growing when their distance to the most advanced economies is large, and poor countries tend to be autocracies. All that is needed to reproduce the observed historical patterns is income convergence and a positive association of income with incidence of democracy, with no assumptions about the effect of regimes on growth. We take Robert Lucas’s macroeconomic model and augment it with regime dynamics identified by Adam Przeworski and colleagues and Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini, calibrate the model, and show that these dynamics account for the data well."
Ideology of Affluence: Explanations for Inequality and Economic Policy Preferences among Rich Americans,"Flannery O’Connor sees bodily difference as a ubiquitous part of the human condition, as well as a reason invoked by society and politics to displace others. O’Connor redefines “the grotesque” to refer to her exposition of the reality of human dependence in a way that shocks her readers. And this grotesque revelation of human dependence is the foundation for a politics grounded in the human need for relationships, as well as O’Connor’s response to individualistic modern politics: she critiques communities in which pure self-interest leads to exclusion and displacement and opens up the possibility of communities that welcome members irrespective of differences in their bodies. Such communities are not abstract utopias but are built through engagement with particular people across lines of difference and need. In the small associations that arise from such engagement—families, religious communities, and other groups—O’Connor’s Tocquevillian hope is found."
“Two Foundings”: An Unpublished Lecture by John H. Schaar,"Scholars who study immigrant economic progress often point to the success of Southern and Eastern Europeans who entered the United States in the early 20th century and draw inferences about whether today’s immigrants will follow a similar trajectory. However, little is known about the mechanisms that allowed for European upward advancement. This article begins to fill this gap by analyzing how naturalization policies influenced the economic success of immigrants across generations. Specifically, the author creates new panel data sets that follow immigrants and their children across complete-count U.S. censuses to understand the economic consequences of citizenship attainment. The author finds that naturalization raised occupational attainment for the first generation that then allowed children to have greater educational attainment and labor market success. He argues that economic progress was conditioned by political statuses for European-origin groups during the first half of the 20th century."
Why Are the Fastest Growing Countries Autocracies?,"Against anthropological notions of “illness narratives” and “social suffering” as the responsible reception of trauma, this article formulates possible directions in which to expand trauma’s conceptual framework so as to respond ethnographically to affective ways of understanding memory, critical agency, and political belonging. Building on ethnographic fieldwork with militarily displaced Kurdish communities in Diyarbakır, in Kurdistan, in Turkey, this article addresses the psychological and political states of spatiotemporal displacement. Taking the encounter of two bereaved Kurdish mothers with antidepressants and antipsychotics as its object of inquiry, the article analyzes the affective state of feeling gêj (“spaced-out,” in Kurdish), making the case that in this colonial setting of necropolitical destruction and displacement, feeling spaced-out is an assertion of political critique. Such fugitive manifestations of colonial wounding reveal not only the constitution of a medical space of informal economic traffic and diagnostic intervention but also transient states through which bereaved Kurdish mothers actively undertake their own constitution and engage with decolonial imaginaries to sustain mental health. These noncathartic states need not be organized, collective, or even resistant in any standard sense to be considered as a form of outrage at colonial oppression and as expressions of dissent."
“A Crooked Cross”: Disability and Community in Flannery O’Connor,"An established finding on ballot design is that top positions on the ballot improve the electoral performance of parties or candidates because voters respond behaviorally to salient information. This article presents evidence on an additional unexplored mechanism: campaigns, that can act before voters, can also adjust their behavior when allocated a top position on the ballot. We use a constituency-level lottery of ballot positions in Colombia to establish, first, that a ballot-order effect exists: campaigns randomly placed at the top earn more votes and seat shares. Second, we show that campaigns react to being placed on top of the ballot: they raise and spend more money on their campaign, and spending itself is correlated with higher vote shares. Our results provide the first evidence for a new mechanism of ballot-order effects examined in many previous studies."
"Laura Anne Kalba, Color in the Age of Impressionism: Commerce, Technology, and Art","There is no country in the world that does not have at least one law or policy dealing with climate change. The most prolific countries have well over 20, and globally there are 1,800 such laws. Some of them are executive orders or policies issued by governments, others are legislative acts passed by parliament. The judiciary has been involved in 1,500 court cases that concern climate change (more than 1,100 of which were in the United States). We use Climate Change Laws of the World, a publicly accessible database, to analyze patterns and trends in climate change legislation and litigation over the past 30 years. The data reveal that global legislative activity peaked around 2009–14, well before the Paris Agreement. Accounting for effectiveness in implementation and the length of time laws have been in place, the United Kingdom and South Korea are the most comprehensive legislators among G20 countries and Spain within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Climate change legislation is less of a partisan issue than is commonly assumed: the number of climate laws passed by governments of the left, center, and right is roughly proportional to their time in office. We also find that legislative activity decreases in times of economic difficulty. Where courts have gotten involved, judges outside the United States have ruled in favor of enhanced climate protection in about half of the cases (US judges are more inclined to rule against climate protection)."
The Citizenship Advantage: Immigrant Socioeconomic Attainment in the Age of Mass Migration,"Proponents of same-sex marriage won four of five ballot measure campaigns in U.S. states in 2012. Many observers have argued that these victories occurred because advocates of marriage equality shifted away from rights-based appeals, and instead framed their cause as being about family, love, and commitment. This article tests this claim by examining campaign documents used in the nine marriage equality ballot measure campaigns that took place from 2008 to 2012. I find little correlation between the use of equal rights discourse and electoral failure, and argue that other factors may account for the observed differences in results. I argue that the popular narrative that the rights discourse was counter-productive to efforts to advance marriage equality is overly simplistic and possibly false."
Spaced-Out States: Decolonizing Trauma in a War-Torn Middle Eastern City,"The idea of population control is often associated with Malthusian views of scarcity and their twentieth-century political and technological legacies. Though sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political thinkers and scientific projectors often described human multiplication in religious—especially biblical and providentialist—terms, they similarly understood population to be constrained by the capacity of limited resources to feed growing numbers, and they sought ways to manage this relationship by “improvements” that combined technological and political innovations in both metropolitan and colonial settings. This article examines how these efforts engaged with population, focusing on several projects relating to food connected with Samuel Hartlib (1660–62) and the Hartlib Circle: Gabriel Plattes’s manifold agricultural improvements for domestic use, Hugh L’Amy and Pierre Le Pruvost’s promotion of colonial trade and fisheries, Cressy Dymock’s corn-setting and “perpetual motion” machines for use in England and Barbados, and John Beale’s promotion of fruit trees and cider. While the Hartlibians developed no theory or doctrine of population and made scant use of demographic quantification, their projects framed the problem of feeding populations central to the management of human multiplication, both as a global, historical concern and as a key problem of colonial empire. They thus shed light not only on the emergence after 1660 of new discourses of demographic quantification, and the background to sustained demographic growth after 1750, but on the origins of population as an object of scientific-cum-political intervention through the medium of food."
How Campaigns Respond to Ballot Position: A New Mechanism for Order Effects,"This article locates Locke within broader early modern European debates about the relationship between money, precious metal, and sovereignty. Against this background, I read Locke’s metallism as a considered (if nonetheless problematic) response to the practical implications of the intensification of interstate monetary movements. Locke used an emphasis on the interstate dimensions of money use in order to reframe monetary value as a function neither of sovereignty nor of the natural qualities of precious metals. Instead, he rooted a nonchartalist monetary nominalism in a social convention that operated on a scale that confounded the agency of any existing political institution or community. I use Locke’s monetary writings as an entrée into the larger history of the emergence of new conceptions of commercial sociality in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. More specifically, I argue that conceptions of commercial sociality developed not only out of the better-studied normative concerns central to post-Hobbesian and neo-Augustinian political thought but also out of an intense engagement with the practical implications of early modern commercial capitalism."
Global Lessons from Climate Change Legislation and Litigation,"In the past two decades, women achieved significant gains in national legislatures by advocating for improvements in healthcare, welfare programs, and the promotion of civil rights. However, extant studies also find that women’s increased representation in national legislatures have led to symbolic tokenism without any substantive gains in terms of policy outputs, signifying their continued marginalization. Utilizing a global sample, this panel study shows that female representation in legislatures are correlated with having better public goods provision in the context of tangible public services that are important to women constituents (i.e., women’s issues). The results are consistent even when controlling for other variables that concern women’s empowerment in society and government, regime type, levels of democracy, economic development, and disparate regional effects. Disaggregated results based on a developing world sample and states that experienced an authoritarian past also show how female representation in national legislatures leads to better infrastructure development. The implications suggest that women in legislatures improve access to basic infrastructure that concomitantly affects the quality of life of citizens, reflecting women’s substantive representation."
The Right Stuff? Assessing the Use of Rights Discourse in Same-Sex Marriage Ballot Measure Campaigns,"Donald Trump’s 2016 electoral victory was a shock for feminist scholars, yet it was no surprise to his legion of supporters in alt-right digital spaces. In this essay, we analyze one of the online forums that helped propel Trump to electoral victory. Drawing on social movement concepts and an analysis of 1,762 posts, we show how leaders of the forum the “Red Pill” were able to move a community of adherents from understanding men’s rights as a personal philosophy to political action. This transition was no small endeavor. The Red Pill forum was explicitly apolitical until the summer before the 2016 election. During the election, forum leaders linked the forum’s neoliberal, misogynistic collective identity of alpha masculinity to Trump’s public persona and framed his political ascendance as an opportunity to effectively push back against feminism and get a “real” man into the White House. We argue that while previous research shows the importance of alt-right virtual spaces in creating and maintaining racist collective identities, we know very little about how men conceptualize gender in ways that inform their personal and political action—and this is to our detriment. We conclude the essay by arguing that feminists need to understand how men cultivate extreme personal and political identities in online forums so that we can better understand how new technologies are used to move individuals from the armchair to the streets."
"Food, Population, and Empire in the Hartlib Circle, 1639–1660","Miguel A. López discusses the processes of historicising Latin American art of the 1960s and 70s, and how current readings of key political events, such as the ‘Tucumán Arde’ episode in 1968, are questioning what has been placed under the geographical and art-historical rubric of ‘Latin American Conceptualism’."
Silver and the Social in Locke’s Monetary Thought,"This study draws from institutional theory, gender stereotypes, and content analysis of 509 ads spanning over more than 50 years to understand the evolution of female stereotypes used in print advertising within the context of the emerging Brazilian market. It explores how institutional control systems originating from societal developments may have influenced the presence of gendered print ads. Our analysis is divided into four Brazilian historical periods where female stereotypes in society and institutions have changed: military dictatorship (1964–79), the lost decade (1980–93), economic stability (1994–2012), and political crisis (from 2013 onward). Our historical analysis provides insight on how societal developments (e.g., women participation in the labor force, in regulation agencies, in senior positions at companies and advertising agencies, and in more organized movements against female discrimination) foster the emergence of more complex systems that directly impact the use of female stereotypes in print ads."
Gendered Governance: Examining the Relationship between Women Legislators and Effective Public Goods Provision from a Global Sample,"In contemporary debates over blocked exchanges, there is a tendency to become fixated on the essentially tradeable or untradeable nature of given goods or practices without entering into the wider constitutional questions raised by the issue of where and when market logic should obtain. This article offers some perspective on contemporary commodification debates by examining an eighteenth-century conversation over ethical and legal limitations on market activity. In particular, it examines Montesquieu’s contribution to debates about the venality of office and the laws prohibiting noble participation in commerce. Montesquieu made some counter-intuitive arguments about which exchanges should be blocked and which permitted in a monarchical regime: he championed blocking noble participation in commerce, and he supported the sale of office. Both positions were controversial in his time and strike many today as patently absurd. But Montesquieu’s thought on the limits of commerce in a monarchy can inform contemporary debates on the ethical and political significance of commodification. The question of how far market logic should extend is ultimately a question of the type of political regime that one is considering. This article contributes to non-ideal political theory by suggesting that commodification debates need to go beyond abstract ethical reflections on markets and become more attuned to the particular constitutional contexts of any given blocked-exchange debate."
Misogynistic Men Online: How the Red Pill Helped Elect Trump,"The Maoist creed depended upon a large core of devout, dedicated believers who sought in their personal lives to abide by the revolution’s teachings. Based on close reading and careful analysis of 679 private letters from 1961 to 1986, this article explores the self-cultivation of socialist personhood by a politically devout married couple and their close relatives, who shared with one another how they lived and felt. A tension between personal concerns with family life and an ideologically charged commitment to personal political progress are identifiable in many of the letters and provide a key to understanding the rise and fall of political commitment and socialist personhood over the course of two decades. The conjugal letters reveal that within this family the husband strategically chose a discourse of class struggle and the wife a discourse of gender equality, and each utilized politically prescribed language to push for their own agenda within the family. It will be seen how the combination of their concerns with family life, the tensions entailed in the gender discourse, and the rise of materialist concerns in the 1970s eventually contributed by the 1980s to their abandonment of communist ideology and self-cultivation."
How Do We Know What Latin American Conceptualism Looks Like?,"What causes electoral violence in postconflict countries? The theoretical literature emphasizes the potential role of (1) ethnic grievances, (2) political competition, and (3) specialists in violence. Our study is the first to test these three hypotheses simultaneously. Using a unique data set on electoral violence in Burundi, we study variations in the intensity of electoral violence between neighboring municipalities, relying on the fact that these are more likely to have similar unobservable characteristics. Interestingly, we find that electoral violence did not result from ethnic grievances, which goes against the commonly held view that this factor necessarily plays a key role in violence in the region. Rather, we show that electoral violence is higher in municipalities characterized by acute polarization between demobilized rebel groups, fierce political competition, and a high proportion of Hutu. The effect of political competition is stronger in the presence of numerous demobilized rebels."
Female Stereotypes in Print Ads: A Longitudinal Analysis from an Institutional Viewpoint,"Racial discrimination persists despite established antidiscrimination laws. A common government strategy to deter discrimination is to publicize the law and communicate potential penalties for violations. We study this strategy by coupling an audit experiment with a randomized intervention involving nearly 700 landlords in New York City and report the first causal estimates of the effect on rental discrimination against blacks and Hispanics of a targeted government messaging campaign. We uncover discrimination levels higher than prior estimates indicate, especially against Hispanics, who are approximately 6 percentage points less likely to receive callbacks and offers than whites. We find suggestive evidence that government messaging can reduce discrimination against Hispanics but not against blacks. The findings confirm discrimination’s persistence and suggest that government messaging can address it in some settings, but more work is needed to understand the conditions under which such appeals are most effective."
Blocked Exchanges and the Constitution: Montesquieu on the Moral and Constitutional Limits of Markets,"This essay focuses on the reuse of film footage from a 1920s German hydrodynamics laboratory in U.S. science education films of the 1960s. By pointing out how these U.S. science education films were seen as a means of recruitment in the Cold War, it makes a case for the power of film as a medium of knowledge circulation with the ability to bridge geographical, chronological, and political gaps. The old footage of flow experiments served as a convenient tool to mobilize people for aerodynamic research. This reuse thus shows that research films were not only used to render visible something that is usually not visible to the human eye, but also for engaging people to serve the government. This essay argues that searching for such reuses of research films can enrich our understanding of the way laboratory traces actually make their way into education, society, and politics."
"Self-Cultivation of the Socialist New Person in Maoist China: Evidence from a Family’s Private Letters, 1961–1986","The primary determinant of minority office holding is the racial/ethnic composition of the legislative district. Using comprehensive data on the race/ethnicity of state legislative candidates in 2012 and 2014, we find that minority candidates still emerge at lower rates than whites after accounting for district composition. Leveraging information about the overlap between congressional and state legislative districts, we demonstrate that the victories of candidates of color for Congress reduce the coethnic/racial demographic thresholds associated with state legislative candidacy and that the same pattern holds for white incumbents and state legislative candidacies. Once accounting for both the race of congressional incumbents and the racial/ethnic composition of state legislative districts, white, Latino, African American, and Asian American state legislative candidates emerge at similar rates. These results suggest that perceptions of minority candidate viability play a key role in structuring contemporary disparities in who runs for office."
From Rebellion to Electoral Violence: Evidence from Burundi,"Following the neoliberal restructuration of the Turkish welfare and banking systems in the 2000s, many veterans of Turkey’s Kurdish war faced debt enforcement due to failed payments for prosthetic limbs. Veterans responded to debt collection by turning their own bodies into spectacles of debt and sacrifice by publicly removing and showcasing their debt-ridden prostheses. The media interest in these prosthetic spectacles further amplified the visceral threat of dismemberment evoked by veterans’ embodied performances. The public debates surrounding “prosthesis repossession” cases extended well beyond veteran welfare issues, inscribing all sorts of social and political anxieties on the amputee veteran body, such as anxieties around the incommensurability between the value regimes of nationalism and neoliberalism or around the Syrian refugees. Providing a window into larger questions about the interconnections between disability, gender, nationalism, and neoliberal capitalism, prosthesis repossession cases show us how debt and disability coproduce each other at the nexus of consumer debt and nationalist welfare in Turkey. By homing in on the prosthetic re-membering and dismembering of veteran bodies in a rapidly changing health milieu, we see how the political economy of violence and the violence of political economy become complicit in the production of debt, dismemberment, and prosthetic rehabilitation."
Can the Government Deter Discrimination? Evidence from a Randomized Intervention in New York City,"This essay turns to John Cassavetes’s 1974 film, A Woman under the Influence, in order to explore what remains unrepresentable about the complex eventfulness of 1970s US feminism. By reading the film through its emphasis on performance and gesture, I look to A Woman under the Influence both as an artifact of the shifting political and cultural logics of “women” as a category of collective experience in the 1970s and also as a generator of affect that tells us something about the historical complexity of 1970s feminism beyond its material, ideological, or directly political manifestations. The focus of the essay is on how we might historicize the production of 1970s US feminism as a mass-mediated event that exceeds our ability to fully represent it. That is, the essay looks to cinema as a means for making the polytemporal multiplicity of 1970s US feminism available as a historiographical question for feminist studies in the present."
Mobilizing Moving Images: Reusing a German Flow Film of the 1920s for U.S. Science Education in the Cold War,"Community-labor coalitions unite grassroots community organizations and hierarchical labor unions with the promise of increasing the effectiveness of each. Little is known, however, about whether and how community organizations benefit from such partnerships. We analyze survey data from the National Study of Community Organizing Organizations and field data from community-labor coalitions in Chicago to identify benefits and drawbacks for community organizations collaborating with unions. We find that community organizations that have unions as members generate more media attention, possess a broader tactical repertoire, and are more likely to mount state-level advocacy campaigns. Those benefits, however, come at the expense of grassroots mobilizing and result in less neighborhood-level organizing, fewer volunteers, and smaller turnouts at protest actions, all of which are vital to community organizing. Understanding these benefits and drawbacks can help advocates adjust strategy, tactics, and goals to ensure the long-term viability of community-labor coalitions."
One Run Leads to Another: Minority Incumbents and the Emergence of Lower Ticket Minority Candidates,"With the election of Donald Trump and landmark wins for populists across Europe, one of today’s most pressing questions is: Why do people support populists? We theorize that citizens who score low on the personality trait agreeableness—those who are more distrusting, cynical, and tough-minded—are more susceptible to antiestablishment messages expressed by populists. Using 13 population-based cross-sectional samples collected in eight countries and three continents, we first show that individuals who score low on agreeableness are more likely to support populists. Moreover, with a conjoint experiment, we demonstrate that it is their antiestablishment message that makes populists attractive to people who score low on agreeableness. As such, this article outlines a broader theoretical framework that links personality to political persuasion. In a time when politicians tailor their messages to the psychological makeup of their voters, it is crucial to understand the interplay between political communication and personality."
Prosthetic Debts: Economies of War Disability in Neoliberal Turkey,"This article explores how Speakers of the House act as foreign policy entrepreneurs. I examine the conditions under which speakers may successfully achieve their foreign policy goals using Henry Clay, Thomas Reed, and Jim Wright as “most likely” case studies. I posit that speakers may act with considerable agency and entrepreneurship in foreign policy, but only succeed under conditions of divided government, when they have significant support from their membership, and when the policy is conducive to legislative action. Even then, speakers may need to use authority outside their formal powers to be successful."
"Gesture, Revolt, and 1970s Feminism in John Cassavetes’s A Woman under the Influence","Political competition in some member states of the European Union has shifted to issues of identity as populist parties take positions defending “the people.” This symposium contribution sketches how polarization goes hand in hand with democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, how a somewhat different dynamic is playing out in the Czech Republic, and how ruling populists in all three states treat the European Union and Russia. It concludes by considering the consequences of this populist and illiberal turn for the European Union’s power and for democratization in the Western Balkans."
Organizing Together: Benefits and Drawbacks of Community-Labor Coalitions for Community Organizations,"In 1971 E. P. Thompson introduced the idea of popular disturbances related to the high price of bread as articulations of a moral economy embodying conceptions of social justice. Adam Smith is treated as representative of a new political economy opposed to these conceptions, which in time subdued this “moral economy.” Thompson’s construction of a moral economy remains valuable, but he was mistaken in his approach to political economy. Thomas Robert Malthus is a more fitting representative than Smith. It is shown that Malthus’s propositions about population and inequality rested on his theological beliefs, not on argument and empirical analysis. In addition to elaborating the “market ideology” that Thompson refers to in passing, it is shown that it is possible to integrate social historical and conceptual argument, not simply favor one over the other."
The Populist Appeal: Personality and Antiestablishment Communication,"Although she was intellectually outcasted during her lifetime, Zora Neale Hurston and her “controversial” politics have been reclaimed by feminists (especially black feminists) since Alice Walker’s 1975 “In Search of Zora Neale Hurston,” first published in Ms. Magazine. In what Kristie Dotson calls a deliberate “act of inheritance,” I contribute to existing black feminist scholarship on the theme of self-respect in Hurston’s work by analyzing its relationship to acts of refusal and black spirituality within a contemporary context. By “self-respect,” I mean maintaining a positive valuation of the self (or one’s social group) that reflects one’s dignity. While there are many ways that self-respect can be achieved, as well as many degrees to which the self can be respected, I am interested in a special case: when self-respect mandates a refusal. I argue that reinterpreting Hurston’s racial politics as refusal, rather than conservatism, reveals the latent racism, disguised as regionalism, in popular liberal discourse. I advance this interpretation of Hurston’s position not to say this is the “real” Hurston (many Hurston scholars point out that she had many faces). Rather, through providing this alternative reading, I aim to provide resources for current problems black folks face today in Northern, white, liberal spaces."
“The Voice of America”: The Speaker of the House and Foreign Policy Agenda-Setting,"Brexit was a project shaped at the fringes of official politics. Unusually, however, it maintained its fringe-like qualities, including its lack of clarity and ambivalence, even as it took center stage in the political affairs of the country for more than three years. In such a transitional period, powerless segments of society, including vulnerable nonwhite communities, face a much larger and more multifaceted crisis than other sectors of the population. The question of border controls and forms of identification for migrants and those of hyphenated nationality is an alarming sign of a homeland turning into a hostile environment. By relying on data gathered in a three-year-long ethnographic study of the Shia Muslim communities in Scotland, I elaborate on how Scottish citizens marked by their religious culture and darker skin are handling the uncertainty created by Brexit."
From Competition to Polarization in Central Europe: How Populists Change Party Systems and the European Union,"This essay serves as an introduction to the US Foreign Policy in the Age of Trump Symposium. Two years into his first term as president of the United States, Donald Trump has made his presence known on the international stage. In articulating his administration’s position on a range of foreign policy issues, he has been called many things, including “antiglobalist,” “nativist,” and “isolationist,” which suggests a break from American foreign policy of the recent past. Is this perceived break indeed real? While many pundits and political watchers believe that President Trump’s foreign policy is fundamentally different from that of his predecessors, political scientists are only now beginning to examine these important questions in detail. This symposium brings together a set of scholars to provide some initial answers and to offer some educated speculations on the short-term future of American foreign policy."
Moral Economy and Market Order,"Although the concept of natural liberty played an essential role in the abolitionist movement, black abolitionist appropriations of the concept are generally reduced to Enlightenment categories of political theory. Through an analysis of Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery, I argue that the abolitionist Ottobah Cugoano developed a novel conception of natural liberty through a process of creolization. Rather than a wholesale adoption of European political thought, Cugoano reinterpreted categories of natural rights philosophy by blending natural liberty with West African social practice and the experiences of the enslaved. His primary theoretical innovation was to divorce natural liberty from freedom as self-ownership and to reorient the concept away from a focus on self-possession, private property, and individual rights toward transnational obligations to end the slave trade. Cugoano is both representative and originator of a distinct tradition of black transnational thought that exceeds the limitations of European political traditions."
“Tell ’Em Boy Bye”: Zora Neale Hurston and the Importance of Refusal,"The history of the English reception of Petrarch’s works is one that has been told without reference to the reign of Queen Mary. This is despite the fact that a history of Marian literary culture cannot be told without reference to Petrarch. Indeed, the English Petrarch had a distinctively Marian phase that manifested itself in three works, two in print and one in manuscript. These are: Tottel’s Miscellany, Henry Parker, Lord Morley’s Tryumphes, and William Forrest’s The Seconde Grisilde. All three appearing during Queen Mary’s short reign, and as products of a particular moment, these works point to a specific idea of Marian literary culture that sought to deliver Petrarch from a less worthy Henrician age. Henry VIII’s sexual and political excesses were sharply criticised at this time, and the moralizing and philosophising Petrarch assumed fresh importance as a model for this critique. Petrarch’s example was therefore also central to a broader cultural renaissance that was both Marian and Catholic, and that helped to establish in poetry what the Marian return to Rome established in politics and religion: a rapprochement of cultures. [O.W.]"
"Andrew’s white cross, Hussain’s red blood: Being Scottish Shia in Brexit’s no-man’s-land","Feminism in Spain is experiencing a paradox. On the one hand, the March 8 movement has held two feminist strikes, attended by multitudes. On the other hand, the far Right has entered representative politics, announcing a battle against feminism. With the rapid ascendency of the nationalist far-right party Vox, Spain joins other European countries where the far Right is on the rise. This article’s aim is to analyze the crucial role of gender in the rise of the nationalist far Right in Spain, arguing that gender is not a secondary issue but a primary field in which this political process is being articulated. The article examines the ways Vox mobilized gender during the national electoral campaign of April 2019 and during their first steps in the Andalusian Parliament. The analysis is twofold: it begins by exploring the framing of Vox’s electoral campaigns, including the national myth of the Reconquista of a Catholic Spain from Muslim rule and the militaristic representation of masculinity within this holy-war frame. It then examines Vox’s relentless antigender discourse, focusing on two prominent issues: first, the far-right opposition to gender violence policy through a variety of strategies, such as denying the gendered nature of violence against women and reversing the roles of victim and perpetrator, and second, the party’s representation of feminism, ranging from its straightforward delegitimization of feminism as an enemy of the Spanish nation to a parasitic-opportunistic appropriation through the defense of a “Spanish feminism.” The case study concludes that the Spanish far Right is gender dependent and that antagonism toward feminism is one of its key features."
Front Matter,"Danielle Allen’s scholarship in American political thought is indebted to W. E. B. Du Bois, yet the nature of that debt is ambiguous. Allen cites Du Bois at key points and adapts some of his most famous metaphors. However, on close inspection, Allen’s adaptations of Du Bois indicate subtle but significant differences between the two authors. This research note explains where Allen borrows from Du Bois and where she departs from him. In the process, it clarifies the theoretical background for Allen’s public-facing scholarship."
Introduction: What Is Populist Nationalism and Why Does It Matter?,"This article defends the thesis that the theory of explanatory causes plays a substantive and nontrivial role in Aristotle’s constitutional theory. The Aristotelian πολιτεία, I contend, is the formal cause of the polis and it is determined by the conception of εὐδαιμονία prevalent among the dominant or ruling political group in the polis. Section 1 defends the general claim that Aristotle’s constitutional analysis is informed by his theory of explanatory causes and the specific claim that the πολιτεία is a formal cause. Section 2 then connects the status of the πολιτεία as a formal cause to the diverse conceptions of εὐδαιμονία which determine regime-types and their laws."
Creolizing Natural Liberty: Transnational Obligation in the Thought of Ottobah Cugoano,"Belief systems are said to be dynamically constrained if a change in one opinion causes a concomitant change in a related opinion. While an enormous literature is dedicated to the study of static constraint (the extent to which individuals hold political views that “go together”), dynamic constraint is rarely studied, especially using experimental research designs. We present evidence from survey experiments conducted with convenience samples of both the mass public and of political elites. Our results indicate that even among respondents whose belief systems are constrained in the static sense, a change in one attitude need not precipitate changes in related attitudes. The lack of dynamic constraint among our elite sample raises the question of how they come to hold political opinions that are constrained in a static sense. We present an experiment that suggests a potential explanation: elites may be more likely to be chided for expressing inconsistent positions."
Marian Literary Culture: Petrarch and the Rapprochement of Cultures,"According to many scholars of public opinion, most of the fast-growing divides between Democrats and Republicans over the last few decades have taken place on moral issues. We find that the process of issue partisanship—the sorting of political preferences along partisan lines—properly accounts for public opinion dynamics in the economic and civil rights domains. However, when it comes to moral issues, the prominent change is a partisan secular trend, in which both Democrats and Republicans are adopting more progressive views, although at a different rate. While Democrats are early adopters of progressive views, Republicans adopt the same views at a slower pace. This secular change can be easily (mis)interpreted as a sign of polarization since, at the onset of the process, the gap between party supporters broadens because of the faster pace at which Democrats adopt progressive views, and only toward the end, the gap between partisan supporters decreases."
Silencing Feminism? Gender and the Rise of the Nationalist Far Right in Spain,"Acemoglu and Robinson recently provided a correction to proposition 1 in “Why Did the West Extend the Franchise” (Acemoglu and Robinson 2000), showing that for intermediate values of q (the probability of social unrest in the future) the unique Markov perfect equilibrium is in mixed strategies. We discuss this correction in the context of a recent generalization of the Acemoglu-Robinson model that allows for a continuous institutional choice by the elite. In that environment, no correction is necessary: there is a unique threshold q* such that the elite liberalizes if q<q* and does not liberalize otherwise. Moreover, the main empirical prediction of Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) generalizes: not only does the elite not liberalize when the excluded group poses a frequent threat of unrest, but conditional on some representation having been granted, the level of representation is decreasing in the probability of unrest."
Languages of Freedom: Danielle Allen on Du Bois and the Declaration of Independence,"This article presents three ethnographic scenes extracted from Brazilian urban life, the earliest dating from 2013. It reflects on the rise of the extreme right in contemporary Brazil, a process that shares similarities with what takes place in many parts of the world. I argue that specific types of militarism, anti-intellectualism, and entrepreneurial monetarism became a part of the daily lives of different social classes as three discursive matrices of a mass movement. Major sectors of the religious world, of the police and military, as well as the professional world and the financial market, offered a political-electoral program for this movement, resulting in Jair Bolsonaro’s victory. This movement of the masses aims to destroy the current political system, perceived as degenerate, and substitute for it a new order, which will produce a new man. The social conflict instilled by this program does not fundamentally organize itself as class struggle, although, paradoxically, it creates them under the guise of a “struggle.” Theoretically, I am interested in the role of daily life and daily conflicts in structuring regimes of power."
Explanatory Causes in Aristotle’s Constitutional Theory,"This article explores the place of ideology and what I call analytic allegiances in the nascent higher education domain in Angola. Based on ethnographic research, it considers the post-War emergence of the sector and its implications for global higher education. Focusing primarily on two institutions, one state, one private, it probes how contesting cold war ideologies continue to manifest through the pedagogic, curricula, and campus-based decisions of higher education leaders in the country. It develops Jonathan Jansen’s notion of “political symbolism” to give attention to individual faculty member’s personal scholarly trajectories that result in analytic allegiances within domains of friendship and influence. It argues that exposure to political and social systems and symbols at formative times of individual faculty’s biographies radically inform the ways in which the emergent sector is being approached and molded today. It demonstrates how the existence of pluralistic knowledge traditions maintained through analytic allegiance and political symbolism have equipped Angola well for the transformative processes required in contemporary higher education."
Do Belief Systems Exhibit Dynamic Constraint?,"Drawing on Marion Fourcade’s notion of ordinalization, we develop a conceptual grammar of comparison to explain a shift in the nature and outcomes of the governing capacity of the OECD over time. We argue that comparison as a mode of governance has been bound into the DNA of the OECD as a lever for advancing political liberalism since the inception of the organization. Moreover, we show that around 1990 the organization injected competitiveness into comparison by embracing ordinal modes of comparison revolving around the vertical ordering of things and people according to their relative positions on ranking scales. Yet, by analyzing the case of OECD statistics on teachers and in particular the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) program, we argue that the outcomes of the mechanism of ordinalization in the context of TALIS have thus far remained muted due to methodological constraints as well as the pluri-scalar politics involved."
Was There a Culture War? Partisan Polarization and Secular Trends in US Public Opinion,"This article explores the class politics of urban public librarianship through “outreach” efforts during the federal War on Poverty, using the Chicago Public Library as a case study. Using federal money available through the Library Services and Construction Act of 1964, major metropolitan library systems spent nearly a decade opening experimental branches in “disadvantaged” Black and Latinx neighborhoods and publicizing library services to “the urban poor.” Although urban public library outreach was nothing new, this effort reflected the influence of both the civil rights movement and the short-lived national attempt to eradicate poverty, and it unearthed the same conflicts. Outreach efforts allowed activists, staff, and “disadvantaged” communities to challenge public libraries’ authoritarianism, but devastating budget cuts in a slowing economy put public libraries on the defensive in the latter half of the 1970s, leaving political conflicts in librarianship and the nation’s cities to smolder as the War on Poverty was gradually abandoned."
Democratization as a Continuous Choice: A Comment on Acemoglu and Robinson’s Correction to “Why Did the West Extend the Franchise?”,"The origins of the armed warfare between rebel alliances that spread across China in the late 1960s have long been obscure. This historical puzzle poses two distinct but interrelated questions: first, how and why did rebel factions form, and second, why did armed warfare follow? The authors develop a theory of political orientations as a product of contingent interactions among rebel groups and military units after the collapse of local governments and derive testable implications for the emergence of factional conflict across regions and over time. The authors then extend the theory to link levels of violence to the duration of time that conflicts remained unresolved in localities under military control, implying that violence intensified over time as the anticipated costs of defeat escalated. Both implications are tested with a national data set of 17,319 political events extracted from 2,246 city and county annals."
“The revolution we are living”,"In the past decades, many studies have focused on various kinds of elites in a complex society, as well as on processes of governance and state administration. This acumen has expanded the repertoire of social meanings in both politics and state processes. However, regarding the corresponding ethnographic information, much has yet to be done. Several articles show how difficult it is to study prestigious institutions and propose alternative research strategies, but very few address the impact such discomfort has on ethnography as a means of knowledge production, over and above participant observation. This paper attempts to link the very challenge of researching powerful individuals to the difficulty of personally dealing with them and writing about them and their hidden agendas. It focuses on the Brazilian Congress and on recent events in Brazilian politics, including the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. It offers some possibilities for studying politics by taking seriously the ethnographic motto “from the native’s point of view.” Is this possible when the researcher has moral objections toward the “native”? How is one to do ethnographic work with people like politicians, who usually hold secrets and tell lies? What sort of knowledge and truth can we draw from such a “dialogue”?"
Expanding Available Futures: Ideological Contestation in Angola’s Emerging Higher Education Sector,"Critics accuse Rousseau’s works of promoting a passive and dangerous nostalgia in the face of the demands of moral judgment, critical thought, and political negotiation. In Émile and its source texts, however, Rousseau presents two modern heroes who follow their nostalgic pleasure to perceive their freedom of will and present duty to act—to achieve what Kant calls “enlightenment.” In “Lettres morales,” Rousseau advises Sophie d’Houdetot to act in response to her “voluptuous” remorse for lost, adolescent enjoyment of moral virtue. In Émile, the titular character realizes his autonomy in his nostalgic regret. He must pursue the pastoral dream of independent agrarian community despite understanding the inevitable failure of the political conditions necessary for community. In both cases, Rousseau raises, for nonideal political theory, important “counternostalgic” passions that motivate moral action in compromised sociopolitical conditions."
Ordinalization and the OECD’s Governance of Teachers,"The late twentieth-century economic liberalization that transformed India from a License Raj to a so-called NGO Raj paralleled a burgeoning interest in Indian hijra communities, aided by discourses about gender/sexuality rights circulating via transnational NGO networks. The opening decades of the twenty-first century witnessed the emergence of multiple life histories written by NGO-based hijra activists that were read as representing authentic hijra life; for instance, A. Revathi’s The Truth about Me and Laxminarayan Tripathi’s Me Hijra, Me Laxmi. Despite the linkage between autobiography and autonomous personhood in metropolitan literary cultures, these texts were read as testimonials of hijra communitarian experience. As one reviewer put it, autobiography “positions the reader as an anthropologist of hijra life.” A closer examination reveals that these works do not present evidence of hijra experience in all its raw immediacy. I will argue, instead, that like the testimonio, the nascent genre of hijra life history presents an idealized time line of movement from exploited subaltern to respectable professional social activist while the actual lives described by it don’t follow such a straightforward trajectory. The subject positions of woman, transgender person, disciple, migrant sex worker, employee, citizen, and author in these writings offer more diffuse genealogies of hijras’ political consciousness. Hijra activists both inhabit and resist incorporation into normative conceptions of belonging by leveraging their embeddedness within multiple competing filial and affiliative networks, from their natal families to their adopted imagined communities to their activist coalitions. Their writings are better read as autoethnographies of activism and enable us to rethink the role of NGOs in queer political life."
“How Much Is Not Enough?”: Public Library Outreach to “Disadvantaged” Communities in the War on Poverty,"Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom has been interpreted as a general warning against state intervention in the economy.1 We review this argument in conjunction with Hayek’s later work and discern an institutional thesis about which forms of state intervention and economic institutions could threaten personal and political freedom. Economic institutions pose a threat if they allow for coercive interventions, as described by Hayek in The Constitution of Liberty: by giving someone the power to force others to serve one’s will by threatening to inflict harm, in the absence of general rules of conduct. According to the logic of the argument, welfare-state provisions are not coercive insofar as they do not allow the identification and discriminatory treatment of individuals. By contrast, we claim that a structure of coercion is likely to emerge from the command-and-control nature of protectionist institutions and immigration restrictions currently advocated by the radical right."
Generating a Violent Insurgency: China’s Factional Warfare of 1967–1968,"Conceptual debates about proportionality and its moral and political force need to be placed in historical and institutional context. Conceptual, moral, political, and practical questions about proportionality are inextricably linked. This insight should lead us away from the dominant conception of proportionality as a moral precept and toward a political conception of proportionality that is inevitably shaped by prevailing conceptions of what proportionality is for and, in modern democracies, is grounded in democratic practices and the institutional structures of democratic states. This insight has important implications for the prevailing disciplinary division of labor, calling into question the tendency to separate conceptual and philosophical from social theories of punishment. It is important to try to understand the conditions under which stable constraints on the state’s power to punish, and accountability mechanisms adequate to guaranteeing the fittingness of punishment by reference to democratically endorsed standards—which seem to be the key animating concerns of contemporary appeals to proportionality—are most likely to be realized, and conversely where they are likely to be most under threat. This is both an important issue in itself, and a case study in the interaction between concept and context."
"Hal Foster and Richard Serra, Conversations about Sculpture","Existing empirical research finds that female candidates have higher levels of qualifications for political office compared to male candidates. An untested assumption behind this finding is that female candidates must have stronger qualifications to overcome feminine stereotypes that characterize women as ill qualified for leadership positions. I test this assumption by drawing on psychology research to develop a theory that explains how a candidate’s sex affects the way voters evaluate the qualifications of political candidates. Using innovative survey experiments, the results show that, across multiple experiments, voters hold female candidates, relative to male candidates, to more stringent qualification standards, and these higher standards limit the ability of female candidates to secure electoral support. These findings uncover a subtle but pernicious source of bias facing female candidates. The implications speak to how candidate sex affects voter decision-making and the ability of democratic institutions to select the best candidates for leadership."
"Notes on Lies, Secrets, and Truths in the Brazilian Congress: The 2016 Process of Impeachment","This article shows how the violence, carceral capitalism, and racialization that characterized Chicago’s drug war politics at the turn of the twenty-first century hold historical roots in the changes of the pharmaceutical industry during the late nineteenth. Historical research on the evolving business cultures of pharmacy during this period reveals that tensions between drug manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers contributed to the familiar operating structure of Chicago’s illegal drug market. The first years of the twentieth century witnessed a modernizing moment for drug war politics when the interests of retail pharmacists and social reformers coalesced on a police reform campaign intent on “waging war” on “dope.” Historicizing the century-old existence of violence, invasive policing, and prison growth in the market shows how the consuming policy challenges of drug war politics have grown in scale over time and hold origins in the old insecurities of a market dominated by mass-produced proprietary medicines."
Nostalgic Enlightenment: Rousseau on Memory and Moral Freedom in Émile and “Lettres morales”,"How do elections and postelection protest shape political trust in a competitive autocracy? Taking advantage of largely exogenous variation in the timing of a survey conducted in Moscow in 2011, we find that with few exceptions the election had little systematic effect on political trust, perhaps because vote improprieties were not new information. In contrast, the unexpected protest that followed increased trust in government. In this case, heightened trust arises largely from opposition voters—those most likely to be surprised by permission to hold the protest—who update their beliefs. We argue that when autocrats permit protest unexpectedly, citizens may update their beliefs about the trustworthiness of the government. Our results suggest that citizens may cue not off the content of a protest but off the government’s decision to permit it. In addition, autocrats can increase trust in government by allowing protest when it is unexpected."
Show and Tell: Life History and Hijra Activism in India,"Scholarship on bureaucratic responsiveness to Congress typically focuses on delegation and formal oversight hearings. Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007 and 2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators—but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential copartisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness—agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential copartisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service. The results suggest that presidential appointees play an important, daily mediating role between Congress and the bureaucracy."
Hayek versus Trump: The Radical Right’s Road to Serfdom,"Over the last ten years, scholars have rediscovered the relevance of council democracy and workers’ councils for democratic thought. While these interventions are important, the literature lacks a coherent reconstruction of the development of council democracy in modern political thought. This article fills that lacuna by distinguishing between three conceptions of council democracy. One conception, advocated by Vladimir Lenin, interprets the councils as revolutionary organs able to destroy the old regime, but unable to govern afterwards. Another conception, favored by the interwar council communists, stresses the ability of workers’ councils to democratize the workplace, providing the germs of economic democracy. The third, delivered by Cornelius Castoriadis and Hannah Arendt, emphasizes the radical democratic nature of workers’ councils as an alternative to representative democracy. We argue that these three conceptions, notwithstanding their fundamental differences, share several core principles that can guide contemporary scholars to theorize the council as part of radical democratic repertoires. Moreover, we show the importance of these principles of council democracy for the constituent ambitions of contemporary movements like Occupy."
"Getting Proportionality in Perspective: Philosophy, History, and Institutions","A record number of firearm background checks were completed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the protests following the murder of George Floyd. Using monthly state-level data, we show that the increase in firearm background check rates in March 2020 and June 2020 differ from previous gun-buying events in at least two important ways. First, the increases in the background check rates surrounding COVID-19 and the George Floyd protests are significantly larger than previous gun-buying events. Second, the gun-buying events of 2020 are nonpartisan; the effect in Republican-leaning states is statistically indistinguishable from the effect in Democrat-leaning states. Our estimates suggest that there were 62 percent more background checks completed between March and August 2020 than expected, which amounts to over 7 million additional background checks. We provide evidence that the recent spikes in background checks are not motivated by gun policy uncertainty and discuss policy recommendations that may alleviate any negative outcomes associated with expanded gun ownership during an unprecedented pandemic."
Shifting Standards: How Voters Evaluate the Qualifications of Female and Male Candidates,"In recent years, revelations regarding reports of torture by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the quiet growth of the National Security Agency’s pervasive cyber-surveillance system have brought into doubt the level of trust afforded to the intelligence community. The question of its trustworthiness requires determining how much secrecy it should enjoy and what mechanisms should be employed to detect and prevent future abuse. My argument is not a call for complete transparency, however, as secret intelligence does play an important and ethical role in society. Rather, I argue that existing systems built on a prioritization of democratic assumptions are fundamentally ill-equipped for dealing with the particular challenge of intelligence secrecy. As the necessary circle of secrecy is extended, political actors are insulated from the very public gaze that ensures they are working in line with the political community’s best interests. Therefore, a new framework needs to be developed, one that this article argues should be based on the just war tradition, where the principles of just cause, legitimate authority, last resort, proportionality, and discrimination are able to balance the secrecy that the intelligence community needs in order to detect and prevent threats with the harm that too much or incorrect secrecy can cause to people."
The Drug War Dialectic in Early Twentieth-Century Chicago,"Civil conflicts are complex: multiple warring parties compete for control of territory both against each other and the government. These processes are often dynamic, changing over time and space. In this study, we embrace these complexities through a network-based approach. By considering important relational patterns, such as reciprocity and transitivity, and tying them together with existing theoretical developments in the conflict processes literature, we answer the question of “who fights whom and when” during civil conflict. Furthermore, by using the case of Nigeria, we offer novel theoretical insights about how the entrance of a new, aggressive actor can decisively alter the trajectory of conflict. In addition, we show that our approach is better at predicting “who fights whom and when” in an out-of-sample context than extant approaches."
"Elections, Protest, and Trust in Government: A Natural Experiment from Russia","Despite growing ideological diversity within the group, black Americans have maintained their overwhelmingly unified support for the Democratic Party. We argue that black Democratic partisanship is upheld, in part, through black Americans’ use of social sanctions (both positive and negative) to encourage compliance with a group norm of Democratic Party support. Leveraging the exogenous assignment of racial social context provided by the race of an interviewer in face-to-face American National Election Study survey interviews of black respondents, we demonstrate the racialized social imperative of black Democratic Party identification. We show that black respondents are more likely to identify as Democrats in the presence of other blacks, particularly those respondents whose conservative ideological placement provides a cross-pressuring incentive to otherwise make an alternative partisan choice. Our social explanation of black partisan homogeneity is a significant departure from previous accounts that have focused almost exclusively on attitudinal ascriptions to racial shared fate."
Politicization and Responsiveness in Executive Agencies,"This article explores the political and social factors behind the adoption of liquor dispensaries in the US South between 1893 and 1907. This wave of state and municipal liquor stores emphasized off-site consumption, a feature that was relatively unique for the time period. Once southern political leaders found that prohibition did little to prohibit the saloon and not wanting to see its return, they sought a middle ground. I argue that it was the presence of pharmacies and the broader acceptance of medicinal liquor as an exception to prohibition that made these off-site arrangements appealing to reformers."
Workers’ Councils and Radical Democracy: Toward a Conceptual History of Council Democracy from Marx to Occupy,"Holding politicians accountable through reelection has long been a focus of empirical research, yet results are mixed in terms of whether electoral accountability works in practice. I offer a new theory of voter behavior to explain why electoral accountability may break down. Where voters perceive a greater likelihood of malfeasance in a second term, information about good first-term performance becomes irrelevant to predicting second-term performance. Instead, voters turn to horizontal accountability institutions for assurance that reelected incumbents will perform well. I test the argument in Peru using a conjoint experiment and regression discontinuity design. I demonstrate not only a mayoral incumbency disadvantage, but also that voters prefer challengers even over high-performing incumbents. I then show that voter preferences are affected by beliefs about increasing corruption and the low likelihood of good performance being repeated and that voter trust in horizontal accountability institutions attenuates the anti-incumbency bias."
"Pandemics, Protests, and Firearms","Democratic publics have always struggled to constrain their elected leaders’ foreign policy actions. By its nature, foreign policy creates information asymmetries that disadvantage citizens in favor of leaders. But has this disadvantage deepened with the advent of the Internet and the resulting fundamental changes in the media and politics? We argue that it has. The current information and political environments erode constraint by inclining constituents to reflexively and durably back “their” leaders and disapprove of opposition. These changes make it harder for citizens to informationally “catch up” with and constrain leaders because views that contradict citizens’ beliefs are less likely to break through when media are fragmented and siloed. These changes have important implications for theories concerning the democratic peace, audience costs, rally effects, and diversionary war. They may also contribute to instability in foreign policy by contributing to sudden and destabilizing changes in public opinion that undercut commitments abroad."
Too Many Secrets? When Should the Intelligence Community be Allowed to Keep Secrets?,"Paul Robeson was a remarkable singer, a brilliant actor, and an engaged political activist. In his college years he was a football star. Throughout his life he campaigned for the rights the poor, the disadvantaged, and the oppressed. His most famous theatrical role was Othello; when he played the part in London and in New York he was one of the first black actors to do so. The New York production ran on Broadway longer than any other William Shakespeare play had done. But Robeson’s life, which included political and racial attacks, the loss of his US passport, and claims that he was “un-American” (he visited the Soviet Union and compared its treatment of minorities favorably to that of the United States) led to a series of encounters in which Othello, both the role and the play, was in effect reenacted in public, culminating in Robeson’s eloquent testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. This essay traces the connections, and the sometimes-uncanny crossovers, between Robeson’s life and Shakespeare’s play."
Networks of Violence: Predicting Conflict in Nigeria,"Organized crime, a fuzzy concept, has been defined in many different, sometimes contradictory ways. Five sets of mafia organizations have for decades been considered the core of organized crime: the American Cosa Nostra, the Italian Cosa Nostra and ‘Ndrangheta, Chinese triads, and Japanese yakuza. These organizations—mafias for short—share seven typifying characteristics: longevity and thus premodern roots and, with rare exceptions, male-only membership; large size; a formalized and complex internal structure; an elaborate cultural apparatus meant to generate lifelong commitment, new identity, and fictive kinship ties; multifunctionality; the goal of political dominion and capacity to provide governance services; and long-standing popular legitimacy and power-sharing with local state authorities. The first and the last characteristics point to reasons for the mafias’ consolidation and persistence: except for the American Cosa Nostra, all emerged in contexts of state weakness or absence and benefited from willingness of state representatives to acknowledge their power. Reduced willingness of state authorities and communities to accept mafias’ power, coupled with premodern features of their structure and culture, explain a further common trait: with the partial exception of the ‘Ndrangheta, all have experienced considerable decline in recent decades."
We Are One: The Social Maintenance of Black Democratic Party Loyalty,"In the theoretical literature on biocapitalism, commercial gestational surrogacy is often treated as a paradigm of the new forms of labor that have emerged with it. I begin by assessing Melinda Cooper and Catherine Waldby’s version of this idea in their influential 2014 book Clinical Labor. Their argument for understanding gestational surrogacy as labor can be interpreted as continuing the tradition of Marxist feminism that demands recognition and adequate compensation for women’s socially reproductive labor. My key aim is to show that once we submit commercial gestational surrogacy to a rigorous Marxist-feminist analysis, however, it becomes difficult to understand it as a form of labor. While I acknowledge some of the political advantages of the labor paradigm, I develop a sustained critique of it by focusing on its theoretical and political shortcomings. I analyze the functional role that commercial gestational surrogacy occupies in the dynamics of global capitalism and identify the aspects that distinguish it from other forms of waged care work. My main concern is not the correct application of Marx or his labor theory of value but rather the feminist political and ethical consequences that follow from the theoretical question of how we conceive of gestational surrogacy and how we theorize the processes of value production on which biocapitalism relies. The goal is to show how different theoretical understandings of gestational surrogacy have radically different political consequences for the feminist debates surrounding it."
"From Pharmacies to Liquor Dispensaries in the US South, 1893–1907: Thinking through One Adaptation of the Gothenburg System","We demonstrate that good government, similar to modern liberal democracies, emerged apart from Western history or influence. This finding is counter to the conventional understanding that democratic state building is an expression of Western-inspired modernity. Yet, we argue, irrespective of cultural context or time period, good government policies and practices will be instituted when revenues that underpin governance are jointly produced, as predicted by collective action theory. We also find that good government will be relatively weakly expressed when private wealth plays an uninhibited role in political agency and when leaders have direct, discretionary control over fiscal economy. These research findings, derived from an extensive comparative study of past societies, provide theoretical support for scholars who argue that contemporary democracies are threatened by economic and political forces that undercut the fiscal foundations of good government while strengthening the link between concentrated private wealth and the political process."
Electoral Dis-Connection: The Limits of Reelection in Contexts of Weak Accountability,"When the Polaroid Corporation launched the now-iconic SX-70 system in 1972, it represented a series of technological breakthroughs. The color film developed automatically, and the collapsible camera was the size of a paperback. Polaroid marketed the product to consumers for everyday use, but the artist Lucas Samaras deployed it to more subversive ends. He pressed and gouged the film’s viscous emulsion, causing his pictured body to ripple, undulate, and appear to float within a sea of chemicals. This essay reconsiders Samaras’s “psychedelic emulsive-bodies” through the methods of new materialism, which emphasizes the distributed agency of both human and nonhuman actors. Such an analysis allows us to make sense of Samaras’s unique practice in both formal and historical terms. The relationship between body and chemical apparent in his series of Photo-Transformations echos the era’s countercultural politics of psychedelia, wherein an emancipatory politics can be found in an unlikely place: the corrupted emulsions of Polaroid’s mass-marketed picture technology."
"Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy in the Age of Social Media","Mercedes Vicente discusses Darcy Lange's Māori Land Project at the intersection of militant film, collaborative practice and political struggles in New Zealand."
The HUAC Othello,"This article considers the role of the public will in The Federalist, arguing that its two primary authors offered differing and conflicting accounts of the precise cause of factionalism and the manner in which the public will could safely be accommodated within the constitutional system. Alexander Hamilton believed that demagogic leadership was responsible for stirring up the otherwise politically apathetic citizenry into factional groups, while James Madison saw factionalism arising naturally, without any impetus from poor leaders. As such, they put forward differing constitutional remedies: Hamilton focused on unifying the public around the person and policies of a strong executive, while Madison relied on the environment of a carefully crafted and limited legislature capable of refining the public will. In this article, I offer a new perspective on the longstanding but often forgotten question of Publius’s “split personality.” I argue that it helps to inform the theoretical origins of the political rift between Hamilton and Madison in the 1790s and that it provides a framework for understanding contemporary questions about polarization, demagoguery, and institutional balance."
What Makes Mafias Different?,"This article examines a little-known but unusually well-documented case of reported administrative corruption on the eve of the French Revolution. In the “Affair of the Gévaudan,” a conscientious low-level municipal official made the decision to funnel information to his superiors about aristocratic malfeasance in the diocese of Mende. For more than two years he carried out a correspondence with the ever-curious intendant of the province of Languedoc, reporting on the bad behavior of the bishop of Mende and a number of the bishop’s subordinates. This rich and self-revelatory correspondence offers the opportunity to explore whistleblowing as a distinct, historically conditioned form of political agency. The novel kind of political subjectivity modeled by the central character in the story, Antoine de Blanquet, suggests the formation of a broad prerevolutionary consciousness informed by an aversion to secrecy, a public-spirited resentment toward self-dealing, and an abiding suspicion of opaque administrative structures."
Feminism against Biocapitalism: Gestational Surrogacy and the Limits of the Labor Paradigm,"After Kwame Nkrumah’s overthrow in 1966, a group of Ghanaian intellectuals brought their specific version of Pan-Africanism into the United States at precisely the moment when Black studies programs were being formed. Consequently, they shaped the trajectory of the field and linked it to a specifically African intellectual project. These Ghanaian intellectuals sought to inject an Africa-centered sense of what political education and political mobilization meant into the framework of Black studies. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Brown University, they worked to make Europe’s ongoing economic exploitation of Africa, the persistence of white supremacist regimes in southern Africa, and the US government’s support of these oppressive forces key parts of the otherwise US-centric curricula of Black studies programs. The role that Ghanaian intellectuals played in the United States helps us illuminate the unexplored intellectual impact of African scholars in the 1970s and 1980s outside of Africa on Black internationalism."
The Fiscal Economy of Good Government: Past and Present,"In 1967, German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed that the Ciceronian topos called historia magistra vitae started fading in the late eighteenth century owing to the new aspects of irreversibility and acceleration that history had gained. History could thus no longer provide lessons for a deeply uncertain present after the French Revolution. Dictator and dictatorship are examples of terms in this dramatic reconfiguration that were rescued from an intellectual register and then used for political purposes. Meanwhile, it was in independent Spanish America that these terms and the reality behind them experienced a renaissance, though under particular circumstances conditioned by the creation of new states. This article discusses two Latin American dictators, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, supreme dictator of Paraguay (1814–40), and Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires (1829–32 and 1835–52), from the point of view of historia magistra vitae. Based on sources that include travelogues, pamphlets, and political essays, it aims to understand the persisting or fading relevance of the topos for the explanation of these authoritarian rulers by contemporaries."
Floating on a Chemical Sea: Lucas Samaras’s Psychedelic Emulsions,Kaelen Wilson-Goldie discusses how Inji Efflatoun’s tumultuous political and artistic life reflects the turns and twists of modern Egypt.
Darcy Lange’s Māori Land Project (1977–80),"What share of citizens hold meaningful views about public policy? Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach a consensus. Researchers agree that policy opinions in surveys are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real or just measurement error. In this article, we revisit this debate with a concept neglected in the literature: knowledge of which issue positions “go together” ideologically—or what Philip Converse called knowledge of “what goes with what.” Using surveys spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from measurement error but from instability in the opinions themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of “what goes with what” and that only about 20%–40% hold stable views on many policy issues."
The Federalist on the Public Will: The Split Personality Revisited,"The Pasteur Institute of Iran underwent a major expansion of its research productivity and international recognition during some of the most significant events of modern Iranian history: the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry, followed by the Anglo-American coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. During this period, the institute’s French director, Marcel Baltazard, was embedded in a complex set of working relationships with his Iranian employees, research subjects, and government ministers; American scientists and foreign aid workers; and French Pasteurians and diplomats. Baltazard constantly described these relationships as instances of “collaboration.” The temporal and geographical context demands a critical reading of scientific collaboration alongside the negative implications of political collaboration. Investigating the political commitments and social attitudes of the French director and Iranian staff, this essay demonstrates that scientific collaboration at the institute both reinforced socioeconomic inequalities within Iran and mirrored global Cold War geopolitics that undermined Iranian sovereignty."
Whistleblowing as Historical Artifact: Administrative Corruption Meets Truth-Telling in Prerevolutionary France,"In this article we analyze Orestes Brownson’s opposition to the Fourteenth Amendment in light of his opposition to slavery, rejection of Southern secession, and support for the Thirteenth Amendment. We argue that his principled opposition to the Fourteenth Amendment derives from the same logic as the earlier positions he appears to contradict. To explicate his opposition, we place it within his broader understanding of the American constitutional order. Brownson thought that the Fourteenth Amendment would do little for African Americans, only enhancing the entrenched powers of Northern business elites while undermining the American republic. Brownson attributed the push for the amendment to the unfolding of what he called humanitarian democracy and the democratic principle. He argued that the democratic principle, once institutionalized within the legal framework of the American republic, would lead to the leveling of social and political institutions and the centralization of governmental authority to enforce that equality."
From Nkrumah’s Black Star to the African Diaspora: Ghanaian Intellectual Activists and the Development of Black Studies in the Americas,"This article examines how Guyana’s storm early warning system shapes political imaginaries of climate adaptation. Specifically, it focuses on the reactions people have to the forms of gridlock that can make intense flooding, and climate change more generally, feel like an insurmountable problem. As I detail throughout this article, gridlock is an object of intervention in the development, maintenance, and operations of the storm early warning system. The management of gridlock is synonymous with aspirations to make more consistent institutional arrangements of vigilance. But Civil Defense Commission staff and village residents run into difficulties making enhancements because gridlock unfolds across multiple historical tenses. That is, as they implement the storm early warning system, gridlock reveals itself as a product of past and ongoing governmental practices that permeate the present in ways that shape uncertainty about the future. In this respect, this article extends conversations in anthropological scholarship on anticipation around the different configurations of political time within contexts of climate change/risk and governance."
“History’s So Strong”: The Topos of Historia Magistra Vitae and the Rediscovery of Dictatorship in Latin America,"In this conversation, transgender studies scholars Susan Stryker and V Varun Chaudhry discuss the emergence of the field of transgender studies and its continued relevance and necessity today. First, Stryker discusses some of the key texts central to the emergence of transgender studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, contextualizing these texts within a broader political context. Stryker then tells the story of the emergence and growth of Transgender Studies Quarterly (TSQ), the first transgender studies journal, since its first publication in 2014. Moving into a discussion of transgender studies in the present, Chaudhry and Stryker highlight an emerging trans-of-color critique and its roots in Black and women of color feminisms. Finally, Stryker and Chaudhry discuss moving into a “more trans future,” where trans serves as heuristic, conceptual tool and method for feminist scholarship. By emphasizing institutional formations and the politics therein, Stryker and Chaudhry contribute a timely, nuanced perspective on the work of transgender studies within a broader field of feminist studies."
Public/Private: The Many Lives of ‘Rebel Painter’ Inji Efflatoun,"While recent scholarship has argued for the utility of W. E. B. Du Bois’s thought for democratic theory, his career-long emphasis on the problem of social equality—and the solution of self-conscious manhood—has gone largely unnoticed. In this article, I argue that while Du Bois’s emphasis on social equality powerfully situates racial oppression as a social and epistemic problem, his solution of self-conscious manhood paradoxically reproduces the very conditions of social inequality he seeks to combat. Open to people of all races, genders, and classes, the path of self-conscious manhood consists in radical truth-telling, a free anarchy of the spirit, a will to strive and act, and the purity of isolation. However, through a close reading of Du Bois’s biographies, editorials, and fiction, I show that self-conscious manhood centers an exclusionary and atomized ethic of self-creation rather than producing a democratic political and social order."
Reflecting Upon James Scott’s Seeing Like a State,"Partisan media—typically characterized by incivility—has become a defining element of the American political communication environment. While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media’s effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively depolarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent’s degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the trade-offs between polarization and incivility and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media."
The Importance of Knowing “What Goes with What”: Reinterpreting the Evidence on Policy Attitude Stability,"The puzzle motivating this article is the nearly unanimous focus in the literature on successful cases of securitization. The article examines this case selection bias and asks about its consequences for the study of security. Three arguments are offered. First, there is no a priori reason to give preference to successful cases; rather, a full range of outcomes should be explored. Second, paying attention to failed cases of securitization might yield important insights for the processes of securitization as well as desecuritization. Third, taking failed cases seriously can put into broader perspective actors’ abilities to use claims about security to accrue power and advance their political agendas. In short, moving away from the fixation on successful cases of securitization will make possible a fuller understanding of what security is and what it does."
Rethinking Collaboration: Medical Research and Working Relationships at the Iranian Pasteur Institute,"This article discusses a recent argument made by a number of Foucauldian feminists that gender is a problematic concept for feminism. They argue that the self-evident status that gender enjoys in current feminist theory and politics is based on the concealment of its historical emergence as a pathologizing discourse in 1950s American psychiatric-sexology, which targeted intersex and trans populations. Claiming that the feminist redeployments of gender risk reinforcing its normalizing functions, they suggest that feminists should consider discarding it as a conceptual tool. Returning to Judith Butler’s account of gender, which also draws on the Foucauldian legacy, as well as developing the concept of trans livability, the article shows that gender skeptics not only downplay the possibility of a critical rearticulation of gender but also ignore the question of gender self-determination. My critical examination thus centers on the tension between the pathologizing history of gender and the possibilities for feminist redeployments of the concept. The aim of my defense of gender is to provide conceptual tools for feminist theorizing and politics that take seriously the normalizing history of gender but commit strongly to a trans-affirmative conception of feminist critique."
Orestes Brownson on the Democratic Principle and the Fourteenth Amendment,"In the contemporary debate concerning European integration and the “problem” of Third World immigration no less than in developments in anthropology in the past decade, the boundedness of cultures and cultural difference have gained new prominence. Anthropology needs not only to explore how globalization affects the discipline’s classical subjects but also to pay more attention to the new ways in which cultural differences and cleavages are conceptualized at its source. In effect, the political right in Europe has in the past decade developed a political rhetoric of exclusion in which Third World immigrants, who proceed in part from its ex-colonies, are construed as posing a threat to the national unity of the “host” countries because they are culturally different. This rhetoric of exclusion has generally been identified as a new form of racism. I argue, instead, that, rather than asserting different endowments of human races, it postulates a propensity in human nature to reject strangers. This assumption underlies a radical opposition between nationals and immigrants as foreigners informed by a reified notion of bounded and distinct, localized national-cultural identity and heritage that is employed to rationalize the call for restrictive immigration policies. Following a systematic comparison of the contrasting conceptual structures of the two doctrines, I conclude that the contemporary cultural fundamentalism of the political right is, with respect to traditional racism, both old and new. It is old in that it draws for its argumentative force on the unresolved contradiction in the modern conception of the nation-state between an organicist and a voluntarist idea of belonging. It is new in that, because racism has become discredited politically, it attributes the alleged incompatibility between different cultures to an incapacity of different cultures to communicate that is inherent in human nature."
Gridlock: Vigilance and early warning in the shadow of climate change,"In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, a contentious debate has ensued in the Democratic Party, and in the U.S. left more generally, about whether Trump’s victory was the result of racist and white nationalist appeals or was powered by an economically anxious and forgotten white working class left behind by globalization. From a Latin American perspective, this U.S. debate about the relative salience of race and class is strikingly familiar. After decades of denying the existence of racism, Latin America experienced a historic expansion of rights for black and indigenous peoples during a “left turn” that coincided with the expansion of social welfare policies, quickly followed by a “right turn” fueled by racist backlash. Thus, taking a hemispheric vantage point reveals that it would be a mistake to believe that class appeals alone are sufficient to counter the current politics of right-wing racist backlash."
World Maps for the Debt Paradigm: Risk Ranking the Poorer Nations in the 1970s,"This article offers a new account of the rise of the ranked nation-state through a genealogy of the category of country risk, which emerged in the 1970s as part of a response to the explosion of sovereign borrowing of petrodollars by Global South and Eastern bloc countries. Incorporating intangible qualities like political stability and the social fabric through a version of environmental scanning, country risk ratings quantified both the ability and the willingness of sovereigns to repay their debts. Adopted by the US Federal Reserve as a means of imposing the rule of law on global finance in the run-up to the Third World debt crisis, country risk returned in the research of the 1990s as a proxy for good governance, transforming the subjective impressions of managers and bankers into objective realities with policy effects."
The Promise of Repair: Trans Rage and the Limits of Feminist Coalition,"This essay theorizes the work of rage at the interface of trans and feminist theories and movements. The juncture of trans and feminist movements is in need of continuing attention given the contemporary resurgence of trans-exclusionary forms of feminist thought and praxis and the ongoing phenomenon of a form of feminist trans tolerance that often falls short of substantive inclusion. I theorize the intersection of trans and feminist movements as a site of affective dissonance and failed care by exploring the multivalent operations of rage within attempts at trans-feminist coalitional politics. I examine how rage can be both world building and world destroying for subjects and collectives, how rage is or isn’t made legible, how (il)legibility informs both whose rage matters and what rage is able to do, and how rage becomes involuted as a form of political depression when the spaces that are meant to empathically hold and witness the range of negative affects associated with oppression fail to do so. Ultimately, the essay is animated by one central question: What roles does rage play in the difficult (and imperative) cultivation of transfeminist coalitions?"
Prioritized Interests: Diverse Lobbying Coalitions and Congressional Committee Agenda Setting,"For most congressional legislation, committee consideration is the first and most drastic winnowing point. Organized interest groups try to influence this winnowing. Many have suggested such influence arises from organizational resources. I offer an alternative view based on the need of policy-motivated committee agenda setters to assess the viability of bills before granting them consideration. Such needs incentivize agenda setters to favor legislation supported by organizations representing diverse industries, causes, and other interests. Analyzing new data on organizations’ positions on over 4,700 bills introduced between 2005 and 2014, I show that committee consideration favors such “interest diverse” coalitions, not coalitions that are large but homogeneous or that give high levels of campaign contributions. These associations are stronger when viability information is more valuable, for majority-party bills and bills introduced during divided government. This suggests that lobbying helps agenda setters identify, and promote, legislation likely to garner widespread and diverse support."
Horizontal Rights: A Republican Vein in Liberal Constitutionalism,"While liberal constitutional theory typically understands constitutions as establishing vertical arrangements in which governments protect individual rights, some courts have introduced doctrines of horizontal effect, holding private bodies responsible for the rights of others. This article argues that we can understand such horizontal rights as a republican vein in the tradition of liberal constitutionalism. While the conventional liberal narrative emphasizes the rights of individuals, horizontal effect builds a catalogue of individual duties as well, corresponding to the commitments and aspirations of a given constitutional order. This article draws on classical and contemporary republican political theory, as well as cases from Germany, India, and South Africa, to demonstrate how the structure of and arguments for horizontal rights reflect proclivities and track commitments associated with republicanism. Although the fact of a republican streak in these rights need not make them antithetical to existing understandings of constitutionalism, it does admit the distinctive potential of horizontal rights to alter elements of conventional narratives about the nature, purpose, and limits of constitutionalism."
"Responsiveness, If You Can Afford It: Policy Responsiveness in Good and Bad Economic Times","Traditional theories of representation posit that political parties have incentives to respond to public opinion, which, in turn, is reflected in public policy as parties come together to form governments. Absent from this chain of representation, however, is the notion of costs. We advance the study of policy responsiveness by arguing that the government’s cost of responding to the electorate is marginal under conditions of strong economic growth but considerable during hard economic times. Cross-national analyses of voters and government welfare policies produce results that are consistent with this expectation. The findings imply that democratic performance, expressed as responsiveness, is conditional on economic growth."
A River Is Not a Pendulum: Sediments of Science in the World of Tides,"This essay explores the history of the silty sediments that make up the littorals of the Bengal Delta to see how they emerged as an object of scientific inquiry and as part of a hydrosocial and political history. By using the conceptual framing of hydrosociality, the piece investigates the political and legal possibilities of amphibious landscapes to document the colonial legal engagement with and scientific puzzlement over these silty sediments and their postcolonial afterlives. As temporary landscapes, silts and sediments pose a unique problem for historians, for they leave scanty archival traces. When they emerge in the state archive it is as sites of conflict, rather than sites of life. They also emerge as a problem for science to map and solve. This essay gathers some snippets of the fragmentary journey of shoals as they emerge and disappear in the scientific and legal archive. Focusing on three moments of interruption in the colonial and postcolonial encounters with the littorals of the Bengal Delta, it argues that the inability of scientific discourse to come up with a conceptual grammar was conducive to new legal articulations about these spaces. Unfortunately, the consequences of this are playing out in the contemporary moment as a humanitarian crisis."
When Crime Policies Travel: Cross-National Policy Transfer in Crime Control,"Cross-national policy movement in crime control has only recently become the focus of scholarly attention. Research findings suggest, despite appearances to the contrary, that fully fledged policy transfers are rare. In practice, soft transfer (in terms of symbolic dimensions of policy) appears more prevalent than harder manifestations (e.g., the travel of institutions, instruments, and practices). Soft transfers are usually associated with penal policies that have emotive political appeal. Hard transfers are more likely to occur when policies have a strong technical flavor. A number of mechanisms influence policy transfer, ranging from purposive and self-conscious lesson drawing to more imposed forms of policy adoption. A number of factors facilitate or constrain the degree to which policies travel and how they take shape during and after the process, from matters of cultural and political attraction to the activities of policy and moral entrepreneurs. This field of research was once dominated by a focus on the Global North as the site of policy transfer or the source of policy influence, but increasing attention is now paid to circulation and spread of policy models within the Global South and from South to North."
"Opportunistic Election Timing, a Complement or Substitute for Economic Manipulation?","Parliamentary governments often use their powers opportunistically to enhance their reelection chances. Yet, how they combine the two most commonly available strategies—economic manipulation prior to elections and opportunistic election timing—remains poorly understood. Do incumbents employ these powers jointly, or does the power to time elections temper incentives to engage in distortive economic manipulation? Previous research gives contradictory answers to these questions. We advance the debate by presenting the first cross-national comparative analysis of the effects of opportunistic election timing on economic manipulation, drawing on data from 20 developed parliamentary democracies. Our results demonstrate a powerful substitution effect: when leaders can time elections, they are significantly less likely to manipulate the economy. This finding not only clarifies the theoretical debate, it also has practical implications for political reforms that aim to prevent incumbents from distorting elections in their favor."
From Conquest to Centralization: Domestic Conflict and the Transition to Direct Rule,"Why do governments centralize control over regions? We present a theory of the transition from indirect to direct rule, focusing on the strategic interaction between a ruler and local potentates who provide civil order in exchange for a share of tax revenue. When the threat of rebellion from below falls and elites become less crucial intermediaries, the ruler is able to centralize power, replacing local potentates with direct agents of the state and investing in a fiscal bureaucracy for future state development. We assess the theory using subnational data from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mexico around the time of a dramatic demographic collapse, which undermined the threat of domestic conflict. Using a difference-in-differences approach and an instrumental variables empirical strategy based on the climate shocks associated with a virulent series of epidemics, we show that state centralization occurred faster in areas experiencing a more dramatic decline in population."
Economic Reasoning with a Racial Hue: Is the Immigration Consensus Purely Race Neutral?,"Leading research is converging on the finding that citizens from immigrant-receiving nations strongly prefer the entry of high-skilled to low-skilled immigrants. Prior studies have largely interpreted this “skill premium” as deriving from sociotropic economic considerations. We argue that a purely economic conceptualization offers an incomplete understanding of the processes generating the skill premium, as it overlooks the role of prejudice as a factor undergirding citizens’ preferences. We contend that the skill premium is a manifestation of prejudice inasmuch as it constitutes a preference for those atypical of the existing immigrant population. Through reanalysis of data from published work, as well as through original survey experiments, we demonstrate that a purely economic interpretation of the skill premium fails a range of critical tests. Our findings suggest that rather than solely representing a race-neutral preference for skilled immigrants, the skill premium partly represents a preference against disliked prevalent immigrants."
“Kans Is King and the Cultivator Is His Subject”: Environmental History and Agrarian Development in Modern India,"AbstractThroughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cultivators and administrators in India contended with the ravages of kans grass (Saccharum spontaneum), a deeply rooted wild sugarcane capable of rendering productive land wholly barren. Difficult to eliminate and endemic throughout India, kans disrupted agricultural efforts in north and central India, particularly in the regions of Jhansi, Bundelkhand, and the Himalayan Terai. Yet the fight against this ecological antagonist was bound up in broader political transformations. As India’s colonial agriculture grew increasingly tied to global markets in the late nineteenth century, and dry regions offered new possible spaces for settled agriculture, imperial administrators grew certain that mechanical tractors held the solution to its eradication. Likewise, postcolonial Indian agronomists cast the production of abundant food as central to their political legitimacy, and they made the eradication of kans a national aim, enlisting the World Bank as a partner. British administrators, nationalist Indians and their postcolonial successors, as well as the World Bank all found a mechanized approach to the eradication of kans politically expedient, at the expense of heeding local ecological and social conditions. The remarkable resilience of kans defied efforts at mechanical removal, and the project foundered until the political economy of Indian agriculture shifted to emphasize chemical pesticides and decentralized control."
Collaborating with the Radical Right: Scholar-Informant Solidarity and the Case for an Immoral Anthropology,"This article investigates the moral content and epistemological utility of scholar-informant solidarity in ethnography. It supports efforts to highlight the potential for immoral outcomes when ethnographers prioritize the interests of those they study during the conception, execution, and dissemination of their work. However, this article advocates reinforcing the imperative of scholar-informant solidarity, recognizing the practice as morally compromised but epistemologically indispensable. I illustrate these claims by referencing my experiences as an ethnographer of white nationalist groups in the Nordic countries. In three case studies, I show how solidarity—and with it collaboration, reciprocity, and advocacy—led to troubling contributions to political causes while offering ethnographic knowledge unlikely to be gained through other forms of research. The article argues further that, while the moral and epistemic consequences of solidarity are exposed in the study of oppressive and violent groups, the potential for power asymmetries and political conflict among scholars and informants is ubiquitous. Therefore, the article addresses the need to embrace solidarity and the immorality that comes with it to ethnographers at large."
Racial Attitudes and Criminal Justice Policy,"Empirical research on public policy preferences must attend to Whites’ animus toward Blacks. For a quarter-century, studies have consistently found that Kinder and Sanders’s four-item measure of “racial resentment” is a robust predictor of almost every social and criminal justice policy opinion. Racial animus increases Whites’ opposition to social welfare policies that benefit Blacks and their support for punitive policies that disadvantage this “out-group.” Any public opinion study that fails to include racial resentment risks omitted variable bias. Despite the continuing salience of out-group animus, recent scholarship, especially in political science, has highlighted other racial attitudes that can influence public policy preferences. Two developments are of particular importance. First, Chudy showed the progressive impact of racial sympathy, a positive out-group attitude in which Whites are distressed by incidents of Blacks’ suffering (such as the killing of George Floyd). Second, Jardina and others documented that Whites’ in-group racial attitudes, such as White identity/consciousness or white nationalism, have political consequences, reinforcing the effects of racial resentment. As the United States becomes a majority-minority nation, diverse in-group and out-group racial attitudes are likely to play a central role in policies—including within criminal justice—that the public endorses."
Hobbes Meets the Modern Business Corporation,"Political theory today has expanded its scope to debate business corporations, conceiving of them as political actors, not (just) private actors in the market place. This article shows the continuing relevance of Thomas Hobbes’s work for this debate. Hobbes is commonly treated as a defender of the so-called concession theory, which traces the legitimacy of corporations to their being chartered by sovereign state authorities for public purposes. This theory is widely judged to be anachronistic for contemporary business corporations, because these can now be freely formed, on the basis of private initiative. However, a close reading of the crucial passages in Hobbes’s work reveals a more subtle view, which rejects this private/public dualism. Hobbes’s reflections on the companies of merchants of his day provide room for business corporations’ pursuit of private purposes, while keeping them embedded in a public framework of authority. Moreover, by criticizing the monopoly status of these companies, he opens up a way to integrate market failure arguments from modern economics into concession theory. The “neo-Hobbesian concession theory” emerging from this analysis shows how concession theory can accommodate private initiative and economic analysis, and thus be a relevant position in the debate about the modern business corporation."
Human Rights and Public Support for War,"One of the most important themes in international relations is the relationship between domestic politics and interstate conflict. In this article, we use experiments to study how the human rights practices of foreign adversaries affect domestic public support for war. Our experiments, embedded in surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom, reveal several important findings. First, citizens are much less willing to attack a country that respects human rights than a country that violates them, even when the dispute concerns military security rather than humanitarian intervention. Second, human rights affect support for war primarily by changing perceptions about threat and morality. Citizens are more likely to view human rights violators as threatening and have fewer moral qualms about fighting such countries. Our findings shed new light on the politics of war in democracies and may provide behavioral foundations for peace among human-rights-respecting states."
"Racial Resentment, Prejudice, and Discrimination","Political scientists regularly measure anti-Black prejudice in the survey context using racial resentment, an indirect measure that blends racial animus with traditional moral values. Explicit prejudice, a direct measure based in beliefs about the group-level inferiority of Blacks, is used less frequently. We investigate whether these attitudes predict anti-Black discrimination and evaluations of the fairness of intergroup inequality. Study 1 used the Ultimatum Game to obtain a behavioral measure of racial discrimination and found whites engaged in anti-Black discrimination. Explicit prejudice explained which whites discriminated, whereas resentment did not. In study 2, white third-party observers evaluated intergroup interactions in the Ultimatum Game, and explicit prejudice explained racially biased fairness evaluations, but resentment did not. This demonstrates that resentment and prejudice are distinct constructs and that explicit prejudice has clear behavioral implications. We also find that explicit prejudice is widespread among white Americans and significantly less partisan than resentment."
"Strategic Proposals, Endogenous Comments, and Bias in Rulemaking","Agencies use notice-and-comment rulemaking to issue countless regulations with substantial economic stakes. The empirical literature on rulemaking has produced a complex set of descriptive findings yet has struggled with informal concerns about selection bias. This article characterizes notice and comment as a persuasion game played between regulators and outside interests. Analysis of this stakeholder-balancing model yields three key theoretical payoffs: an informational rationale for regulators to write rules with higher private and social costs, an explanation for strategic positioning by regulators even without oversight, and clarification that adverse priors are a more powerful mobilizing force than adverse policies. The model’s two-sided selection dynamics reveal that well-established empirical regularities are inconsistent with extreme public-interest zealotry and strong capture but fit a range of intermediate outcomes. To obtain deeper insights about bias in rulemaking, the model suggests focusing on the cost of rule revision, rule movement following abstention, and variation in stakeholder preferences."
"An Alternative Genealogy for Global Capitalism: The Rhine Becomes an Inland Sea, 1792–1815","This article argues that the change that opened the door to a capitalist world, one dominated by capitalist norms, was the alteration to the boundary between economic and public power that followed the era of the democratic revolution and in particular the French Revolution. There is consensus of the institutional creativity fostered by the resistance to Louis XIV. The role of the French Revolution and the Congress settlement in fostering capitalist innovation has not attracted the same attention. This article advances the view that the Congress settlement transposed the political universalism of the Revolution into an economic register. The article focuses on the evolution of the international legal regime regulating trade on the Rhine to illuminate the genealogy of capitalist universalism."
Lessons from Social Work’s History for a Tumultuous Era,"For more than a century, political-economic, demographic, and ideological forces have shaped US social work. Torn between social justice and status enhancement, the profession vacillated between advocating for social reform and seeking elite support. Ongoing contradictions between empowerment and expertise, social change and social control, and collaboration with and coercion of constituents reflect this tension. During the past 4 decades, neoliberalism, antiwelfare perspectives, and hyperpartisan politics transformed social work practice and its research and knowledge base. The 2016 election rocked the profession and produced significant changes for the people with whom we work and the nature of social work. New social movements, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, and global action over climate change and gun violence have also posed new challenges. Social workers must now reexamine long-standing assumptions about practice and evidence; their relationship to power, place, and context; and their role in shaping the future of US society."
“A Vibrant National Preoccupation”: Embracing an Energy Conservation Ethic in the 1970s,"AbstractThis article examines the popularity of the “energy conservation ethic” in the United States during the 1970s, which environmentalists, politicians, and oil companies endorsed as a solution to the energy crisis. It demonstrates that broad support for an energy conservation ethic contained two competing paradigms: one “ecological” and the other “nationalist.” The former advocated conservation as a means to a sustainable low-carbon future, while the latter viewed the conservation ethic as a tool to eliminate dependence on foreign oil in order to reestablish the economic and geopolitical strength of the United States. Thus, in contrast to a view that traces a relatively linear transition from the utilitarian and nationalist ethos of early twentieth-century conservationism to the more holistic concern with “the environment” of the postwar environmental movement, this article underscores the persistence of utilitarian conservationist conceptions of resource stewardship in the middle of the “environmental decade.” These competing paradigms contributed to the argument for energy price deregulation as the most effective way to discipline US energy consumers. In this way, the energy crisis and the conservation debates that it evoked reflected the rightward turn of the United States in the 1980s. Current energy history tends to focus on the political, environmental, and socioeconomic histories of energy production and consumption rather than efforts to reduce demand but, as this article demonstrates, discourses of conservation can also shape political trajectories in unexpected ways."
Countering Capture: Elite Networks and Government Responsiveness in China’s Land Market Reform,"Government responsiveness is often viewed as a result of political pressure from the public, but why do politicians facing similar pressure sometimes differ in their responsiveness? This article considers the configurations of elite networks as a key mediating factor. We argue that access to external support networks helps improve politicians’ responsiveness to ordinary citizens by reducing their dependence on vested interests, and we test this claim using China’s land market reform as a case. Leveraging novel city-level measures of mass grievances and political networks, we demonstrate that the intensity of land-related grievances is on average positively associated with reform occurrence, but this association is only salient among a subset of city leaders who enjoy informal connections to the higher-level authority. We also show that connected leaders tend to implement policies less congruent with local bureaucratic and business interests. These findings underscore the importance of intra-elite dynamics in shaping mass-elite interactions."
The Microrelations of Urban Governance: Dynamics of Patronage and Partnership,"The classic urban ecological paradigm envisioned the articulation of the social organization of neighborhoods with that of the city as a whole. This article offers novel empirical evidence in support of this proposition. We analyze the microrelations of governance across two key urban domains, politics and nonprofit organizations, and identify the district-based politician as a key actor linking neighborhood-based and citywide forms of social organization. Using data of contracts allocated by city council members to nonprofits in New York City, analysis of the social network system linking these two types of actors shows two distinct relational dynamics: a patronage dynamic characterized by exclusive and long-lasting relationships between a council member and his/her local constituency and a partnership dynamic characterized by citywide relationships that are short-lived and fostered by organizational differentiation and embeddedness. Furthermore, politicians and nonprofits differently accommodate the copresence of these two models of resource allocation."
"How Voters Use Contextual Information to Reward and Punish: Credit Claiming, Legislative Performance, and Democratic Accountability","Research has shown that constituents do not evaluate legislators more favorably for claiming credit for delivering large grants than for delivering tiny ones. It remains unclear whether the observed lack of sensitivity to the amount of money claimed reflects indifference to grant size or a lack of contextual information. Building on Grimmer et al.’s Impression of Influence, we perform a survey experiment in which we give respondents information about both the absolute and relative size of projects. We find that respondents evaluate legislators more favorably for claiming credit for relatively large projects. Our results suggest that subjects are responsive to the magnitudes in claims of legislative accomplishment when provided a benchmark. We also find that subjects are more inclined to punish legislators for delivering grants of below average size than they are to reward them for delivering grants of above average size, and we discuss possible mechanisms that could explain this asymmetric effect."
Do Partisan Types Stop at the Water’s Edge?,"A growing number of analyses presume that distinctive “partisan types” exist in the American public’s eyes in foreign policy, with implications for questions ranging from the ability of leaders to send credible signals by going against their party’s type to the future of bipartisanship in foreign policy. We offer the first systematic exploration of partisan types in foreign affairs, exploring their microfoundations and scope conditions using two national survey experiments. We find that partisan types vary across foreign policy issues, but are generally weaker and less distinct in foreign affairs than in domestic politics. We also find that there is an impressive amount of congruence between the partisan stereotypes Americans hold and actual distributions of partisan preferences. Our findings have important implications for the study of public opinion, “against-type” models, and the domestic politics of interstate conflict."
From Völkerpsychologie to Cultural Anthropology: Erich Rothacker’s Philosophy of Culture,"Erich Rothacker (1888–1965) was a key figure in early twentieth-century philosophy in Germany. In this article, I examine the development of Rothacker’s philosophy of culture from 1907 to 1945. Rothacker began his philosophical career with a “völkerpsychological” dissertation on history, outlining his early biologistic conception of culture (1907–13). In his midcareer work, he then turned to Wilhelm Dilthey’s (1833–1911) Lebensphilosophie (philosophy of life), advancing a hermeneutic approach to culture (1919–28). In his later work (1929–45), Rothacker developed a cultural anthropology. I will argue that Rothacker’s later theory of culture retained key motifs of his earlier works. In this way, I trace central aspects of Rothacker’s reception of both Völkerpsychologie and Lebensphilosophie. The article focuses on two aspects of Rothacker’s philosophical development that deserve more attention than they have received to date: his reception of Völkerpsychologie and the political character of his theories of culture. Rothacker’s theoretical work was closely connected to his political conservatism, which culminated in his engagement with National Socialism. The article unearths problematic aspects of the legacy of Völkerpsychologie and Lebensphilosophie in early twentieth-century German thought."
Understanding Journalist Killings,"Why do state authorities murder journalists? We show that the majority of journalists are killed in democracies and present an argument that focuses on institutional differences between democratic states. In democracies, journalists will most likely be targeted by local state authorities that have limited options to generally restrict press freedom. Where local governments are elected, negative reporting could mean that local politicians lose power and influence, especially if they are involved in corrupt practices. Analyzing new global data on journalist killings that identify the perpetrator and visibility of the journalist, we show that local-level elections carry an inherent risk, particularly for less visible journalists. Killings perpetrated by criminal groups follow a similar pattern to those by state authorities, pointing to possible connections between these groups. Our study shows that without effective monitoring and accountability, national democratic institutions alone are unable to effectively protect journalists from any perpetrator."
The Study of Executive Policy Making in the US States,"Scholarly attention on executive policy making has largely focused on presidents and the federal bureaucracy. Yet, state policy making is just as important given its immediate influence on our daily lives. This article provides a guide to studying this area for interested scholars. First, I make the case for why state executive policy making is important and its advantages over the federal level. Second, I outline four approaches to researching this area: (1) asking state-specific questions, (2) using the states to strictly test federal-level theories, (3) leveraging state-level data to test underlying mechanisms of theories developed for the federal level, and (4) examining intergovernmental interactions. I conclude by highlighting the available resources for such research, while calling attention to areas needing improvement."
"Past Place, Present Prejudice: The Impact of Adolescent Racial Context on White Racial Attitudes","Extensive research on racial contexts suggests that white Americans living near black Americans adopt more negative racial attitudes. Theoretically, local intergroup exposure has been conceptualized as acting contemporaneously through various mechanisms. However, a separate body of research on political socialization indicates that adolescent experiences are often especially influential. We hypothesize that whites’ racial contexts during adolescence produce prejudiced responses. We then test this hypothesis using two complementary data sets, a population-based panel conducted 2007–13 and the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Survey (1965–97). Our analyses demonstrate the enduring influence of adolescent contexts at larger levels of aggregation: while the racial composition of whites’ current counties is not a consistent predictor of racial prejudice, the racial composition of their county during high school is. Proximity during one’s formative years increases racial prejudice years later, providing new insights about local contextual effects and the roots of racial prejudice."
Satisfaction with Democracy and the American Dream,"Many studies show that past and current economic conditions are strong determinants of citizens’ attitudes toward government and political institutions. In this article, we develop a forward-looking theory and argue that economic expectations also drive the level of satisfaction with democracy. Crucially, we contend that this relationship is conditional: hope for a better tomorrow matters more to the poor and to those who live in less affluent countries. We use survey data from 34 countries to study the conditional relationship between economic expectations and satisfaction with democracy and find that the allure of the “American Dream” can be more or less potent, depending on one’s place on the socioeconomic ladder. These findings contribute to our understanding of a fundamental aspect of political life: support for democracy may rest on a coalition between the wealthy and those who expect to become wealthy."
Stakeholder Participation in Policy Making: Evidence from Medicare Fee Schedule Revisions,"To what extent do the material stakes of specific policies motivate political participation by affected interests? We address this question by examining physician participation in the annual process governing revisions to Medicare fee schedules. This setting permits us to identify the relevant universe of affected actors and to construct a novel measure of the annual financial consequences of proposed policy changes that varies idiosyncratically at the individual level. Employing text analysis to identify who participates in the notice-and-comment process between proposed and final rules, we find that while few providers comment, the odds of participation vary dramatically as a function of a rule’s impact, with anticipated losses motivating comments substantially more than gains. This relationship persists in both individually tailored and mass comments and is largely independent of the behavior of physician specialty societies. Evidence of the effect of these stakes on campaign contribution behavior is more modest."
An ad hoc Regionalism? The Visegrád Four in the “Post-Liberal” Age,"This symposium contribution analyzes the trajectories of the Visegrád Group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) regionalism from the viewpoint of the crisis of international liberal order. I argue that, although illiberal developments and Euroskepticism in the Visegrád Four (V4) states pose a local challenge to the liberal order, this region is still tightly plugged into the Western liberal order because it is dependent on Euro-Atlantic institutions for stability. Outsourcing important political, security, and economic agendas to Western institutions allowed the four states to preserve the V4 as an ad hoc regionalist format in which they actively addressed only some issues and crises. This argument is rooted in hegemonic stability theory, offering a new conceptualization of the region, which has now arguably moved into a new period in its history—one that has gone from full normative conformity with Western standards to a hybrid position of embedded illiberalism or even partial revisionism of the Western liberal order, in which illiberal developments are combined with a high degree of dependence on the Western liberal order. The article uses theories of liberal hegemony and also draws on more recent scholarship on so-called “embedded revisionism,” situating the V4 in the current international relations debates on transformations of the world order."
Anticarceral Internationalism: Rethinking Human Rights through the Imprisoned Black Radical Tradition,"From Garveyism to the Black Panthers, from campaigns to free political prisoners to the current fight to #FreeThemAll, imprisoned Black activists and their allies have deployed expanded conceptions of human rights. These anticarceral organizers have internationalized the struggle against state violence by condemning genocidal police and prison practices at the United Nations, building global solidarities, and appealing to the world. In redefining traditional understandings of human rights, imprisoned Black radicals have called forth a right to breathe in the face of state killings, a right to resist in individual and collective self-defense, and a right to repair in restorative and abolitionist terms. Rethinking human rights through the imprisoned Black radical tradition offers insight into the genealogy of a major anticarceral thread of Black internationalism that has been reanimated in the current phase of the global struggle for Black liberation."
Undoing Academic Cultures of Militarism: Turkey and Beyond,"What can we learn from exploring the history of the questions that could not be asked, the connections that could not be made, and the research that could not be done? What are the challenges of demilitarization for society and political institutions at large, when academic research itself is shaped by layers of silence? Asking these and other questions, this article proposes “methodological militarism” as a tool to understand the deeply ingrained workings of militarism in academic knowledge production and engages in a search for the “better story” of demilitarizing academia. Since January 2016, more than 2,000 academics in Turkey have been facing the dire consequences of having signed the Academics for Peace petition asking for an end to militarized state violence and human rights violations in Turkey’s southeastern cities. Departing from this moment of rupture and focusing critically on my own scholarship, the article raises questions about the historical making of the academic cultures of militarism as well as the limits and possibilities of their unmaking."
Republican-Majority Appellate Panels Increase Execution Rates for Capital Defendants,"We use the quasi-random assignment of cases to three-judge panels on the US Courts of Appeals to assess the consistency of adjudication of death penalty appeals. We find clear evidence that panels apply different standards depending on whether a majority of the panel was appointed by Democratic or Republican presidents. Unlike previous work on panel effects in the US Courts of Appeals, we show that these effects persist to the end of the process of adjudication. Since the early 1980s, the probability of ultimate execution has been increased for inmates when their first court of appeals case was assigned to a panel with a majority of Republican appointees."
Visualizing Race at the Polling Place: Thomas Waterman Wood’s American Citizens,"This article examines Thomas Waterman Wood’s 1867 painting American Citizens, which depicts four voters, one of whom is an African American. Past interpretations have emphasized themes of equality and citizenship that must be reconsidered in light of nineteenth-century voting practices. As a means to understand American Citizens in a larger historical context, this article looks at the rhetoric of race and citizenship surrounding the extension of the franchise, the structures of nineteenth-century voting, and the means by which visual typologies were mobilized for partisan ends. Exercising the franchise was a public, often spectacular, event that placed voters in a visual context that served to affirm or deny citizenship and manliness. Treatment of voters was often based on visual cues combining references from genre painting, journalism, and popular culture. While celebrating the extension of the franchise to men of color, Wood’s painting also replicates the process of visually identifying race and ethnicity, often for detrimental ends, within American political life."
Contributors,"Deindustrialization was one of the most disruptive social transformations of the twentieth century. Why did democratic capitalist regimes permit and survive this process, while state socialist regimes did not? Drawing on historical evidence from the United Kingdom, Poland, and the United States, this article advances two mechanisms as explanation: first, enabled by the polity-economy distinction characteristic of capitalism, the belief that “there is no alternative” (TINA) could appear credible in the West but not the East. Second, the Western turn toward market-led deindustrialization reduced the economic costs of deindustrialization and, more important, deprived unrest in the West of focal points for protest, lowering political costs too. Strengthening the case for these two mechanisms, I rule out four alternative explanations: generic inefficiency in planned economies, differential elite views on the necessity of structural change, immediate acquiescence by Western electorates or unions, and a uniquely successful return to high growth rates in the West."
TINA and the Market Turn: Why Deindustrialization Proceeded under Democratic Capitalism but Not State Socialism,"European liberals have viewed themselves as the avatars of the rational individual as opposed to the mob or tyrant. Faced with the populist, democratic, and egalitarian character of US society, American liberals could not take this point of view for granted. For that reason, they turned to Freud, although with mixed success. I explore this turn in three consecutive moments: the New Deal, when liberals first understood America to be not only a class society, but a mass society; Richard Hofstadter’s theory of paranoia, which he applied to the right-wing born with McCarthyism; and the New Left and feminist attempts to remake liberalism into a more democratic and multicultural creed. In all three cases, I argue that the liberal commitment to capitalist property relations and the market limited its ability to advance a more robust and democratic politics."
Liberalism and Mass Psychology: The American Experience,"On May 25, 2018, Irish citizens voted in a referendum to repeal a constitutional amendment to allow for reform of Ireland’s prohibitive law on abortion. In this article, I examine parts of the Irish repeal campaign, focusing particularly on the interplay between “public” and “private” in the context of a public, feminist campaign that sought changes to public policy on matters that have traditionally been conceived of as private. I also explore some affective elements of the campaign, including its rejection of shame through visibility and exposure, and the emotive testimony it relied on. The article thus highlights the centrality of feeling to this particular feminist campaign, pointing to emotion as shared political phenomenon that cuts across public and private spheres to motivate political change. In so doing, it develops a largely undertheorized aspect of Judith Butler’s work, establishing the affective dimension of vulnerability in the context of feminist campaigning. My analysis thus delineates the role of public and private in the exposure entailed by affective vulnerability as a means of nonviolent, feminist resistance and points to women’s testimony and the affective revealing of trauma as a means of making the ideas of public and private tangible and translatable into grassroots feminist activism."
"Feminists Redraw Public and Private Spheres: Abortion, Vulnerability, and the Affective Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment","I argue that racism is essentially a civic character trait: to be a racist is to have a character that rationally reflects racial supremacist sociopolitical values. As with moral vice accounts of racism, character is my account’s primary evaluative focus: character is directly evaluated as racist, and all other racist things are racist insofar as, and because, they cause, are caused by, express, or are otherwise suitably related to racist character. Yet as with political accounts of racism, sociopolitical considerations provide my account’s primary evaluative standard: satisfying the sociopolitical standard of racial supremacy is what makes racist character racist."
Racism as Civic Vice,"A cover of the Black Panther newspaper depicting American Indian Movement leaders at Wounded Knee features Oglala elder Frank Fools Crow holding a ceremonial pipe in his uplifted fist, a gesture that resembles the Black Panther salute. The 1974 cover layers the iconographic programs of Native and Black social justice movements; it is a graphic statement of intersectional political resistance. Moreover, the paper’s coverage of the 1973 Wounded Knee occupation and subsequent trials makes a radical visual argument for the ideological continuity of Red Power and Black Power. This essay proposes that the newspaper’s visual director, Emory Douglas, developed an intersectional liberation aesthetics that transformed the critique of structural oppression into a sustained call for radical revolution. Reporting in the Black Panther consistently addressed “all oppressed people,” a perspective that remains relevant for activists today."
Red Power in the Black Panther: Radical Imagination and Intersectional Resistance at Wounded Knee,"The archaeological record of the American Eastern Woodlands has been the subject of research on the origins and organization of complex societies for decades. Much of this research, ultimately grounded in political-economic theories of accumulation, underscores how foraging, horticultural, and agricultural societies manifested complexity in different ways belying their similar signposts of complexity, including monumental architecture, long-distance exchange, and craft specialization. Here, we contend that aspects of these material practices, which span the Late Archaic, Middle Woodland, and Early Mississippian periods, are essential for sketching a historical ontology of social complexity in indigenous eastern North America. Drawing on political-economic theories developed in sub-Saharan Africa, we propose that the deep time ebb and flow of complex social formations in the Eastern Woodlands relied less on the quantitative accumulation of wealth in things and people and more on the qualitative composition of the diverse knowledge embedded in people and things. We discuss Poverty Point, Ohio Hopewell, and Cahokia from this vantage point in an effort to begin telling a “big history” of the Eastern Woodlands outside the frame of social evolution."
Composing Complexity in the Eastern Woodlands,"Political theorists had vigorous debates about nuclear weapons in the 1980s but have been largely silent about them recently. This article seeks to reopen those discussions. It evaluates the main justifications for nuclear proliferation since 1945: arguments from consistency, nationalism, democratic legitimacy, self-defense, peaceful effects, and supreme emergency. Most of these arguments are badly flawed, as are the arguments for retaining the nuclear arsenals of many of the established nuclear powers. Instead, this article proposes a first cut at a stringent standard for judging the acquisition of strategic nuclear weapons, drawing on jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles."
Just and Unjust Proliferation,"This article examines the rhetorical invocation of “secular ethnicity” among diasporic Syriac Orthodox Christian activists living in the Netherlands as they seek political recognition as an endangered, indigenous ethnoreligious group of the Middle East from the UN Human Rights Council, the Dutch state, and their local municipal government. In tracing how their efforts to stake a politically salient ethnic identity on the holy rites and rituals of the Syriac liturgical tradition are legible to some audiences while remaining illegible to others, I analyze how secularity intertwines with theologically informed ritual practices in geographically variable ways to shape how Syriac Christian kinship is reproduced in diaspora. I analyze these intertwined forms of legibility and illegibility through the notion of perforation, which I offer as an alternative to the one-dimensional metaphor of secular rupture, in order to show how diasporic Syriac Orthodox kinship is premised on the conviction that Christianity is an inherent, rather than an optional, dimension of human personhood. Ultimately, I argue that secular power and its effects are subsumed within other historical processes of division and reconciliation in a broader contest over the proper dispensation of political and ritual power throughout the history of Christianity."
"Perforating Kinship: Syriac Christianity, Ethnicity, and Secular Legibility","A ballot reform was adopted in Colombia in early 1990s. The traditional paper ballots, which were printed and distributed by parties, were replaced by an Australian ballot—an office-centered design in which the electoral authority was responsible for its distribution. The article examines about 5,800 department-level legislative lists, during 10 election cycles between 1970 and 2002, to evaluate the consequences of the reform. The evidence shows that candidates expanded the geographical scope of their campaigns after the ballot reform and that party bases became more geographically dispersed. Moreover, the evidence indicates that the new ballot undermined the power of party leaders to coordinate factions, resulting in a considerable increase in the number of lists—and with it, of wasted votes. These findings suggest that an arguably minor reform, such as the adoption of a new ballot form, may have major implications for democratic representation."
The Burden of Election Logistics: Election Ballots and the Territorial Influence of Party Machines in Colombia,"Scholars have long recognized the importance of timing in political decision making. In this article, I consider the potential for the strategic timing of court decisions involving the constitutional review of statutes. As courts lack the ability to directly implement their decisions, scholars have identified an attentive public as invaluable for judicial authority. Building on this literature, I argue that the proximity of a national election increases awareness and thereby creates an environment conducive to the assertive exercise of constitutional review. I then present evidence of the electoral cycle’s effect on decision making at the German Federal Constitutional Court."
"Elections, Public Awareness, and the Efficacy of Constitutional Review","The existing literature identifies campaigns as an important tool of policy implementation for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, scholars have yet to reach agreement about the effects of campaigns on policy outcomes. This article helps to provide answers through an analysis of an affordable housing campaign adopted by the central government between 2011 and 2015. My findings are confirmed using regression analysis of a large original data set that I compiled. The article finds that the campaign strengthened the political incentives for local officials and that they responded to the campaign by building more affordable housing. But the campaign’s effects varied across different types of localities, which led to a significant mismatch between the allocation of government resources and the actual needs of local residents. These findings point to the defects of campaign-style implementation and China’s need for more institutionalized mechanisms to implement policies prioritized by the national government."
Campaign-Style Implementation and Affordable Housing Provision in China,"Sustainable trust building is a crucial yet underanalyzed process, both in its successes and its more common failures. Because the politics of masculinization and feminization play salient roles in so many sustained and unsustained trust-building efforts, it is valuable during any public health crisis anywhere to pay close attention to women as trust builders and to nurses as feminized actors."
Femininity and the Paradox of Trust Building in Patriarchies during COVID-19,"This article concerns how a critical theory of reification should be conceptualized to grasp the 2007 crisis, state-imposed austerity, and the rise of right-wing authoritarian populism. It argues that Jürgen Habermas’s, Axel Honneth’s, and Georg Lukacs’s interpretations of reification cannot provide a theoretical framework for a critical social theory of these developments due to their inadequate theories of domination, crises, character formation, and historical development. It then outlines a critical theory of reification that draws on Max Horkheimer’s notion of reified authority and contemporary Marxian critical theory’s interpretation of the critique of political economy to conceive of domination, crises, and character formation as inherent to the reproduction of capitalist society, which is characterized by a process of historical development that drives humanity into new types of barbarism. It concludes by indicating how such an approach, in contrast to Habermas’s, Honneth’s, and Lukács’s theories, provides a conception of reification that can grasp our present moment."
Reification and the Critical Theory of Contemporary Society,"The rhetoric of populist politicians is an important part of their appeal; however, little is known about how that rhetoric operates. Drawing on two large experiments conducted with American adults, we show that frames encouraging individuals to consider political problems in dispositional terms prompt populist expressions, while an encouragement to consider these same problems situationally does not. In our second experiment, we connect this framing change to voting intentions and find that subjects exposed to dispositional frames are more likely to express support for Donald Trump and less likely to express support for Hillary Clinton than subjects exposed to situational frames. We find the same pattern when we compare Bernie Sanders with Clinton but not when we compare Trump with Sanders. Importantly, the impact is contingent on preexisting populist attitudes; subjects with lower populist attitudes are more likely to demonstrate an increase in expressed populism and support for populist candidates."
Framing and Blame Attribution in Populist Rhetoric,"Contemporary accounts note that audiences laughed heartily at Thomas Middleton’s scandalous play A Game at Chess. But do we really know what they were laughing at? Only partially. Drawing on recent research in early modern wit, I reconsider the place of laughter in the play and its polemical source texts by exploring significant late-Jacobean debates about religious laughter, mockery, personation, and theater. These debates enable a clearer understanding of how laughter works in the play, allowing us in turn to reassess A Game at Chess as a response to the political crisis of 1624 when war between Britain and Spain seemed imminent. [A.S.]"
Polemical Laughter in Thomas Middleton’s A Game at Chess (1624),"Niche party leverage over mainstream party policy agendas is a central theme in the issue competition literature. The literature has underlined that the electoral threat associated with niche party issue mobilization guides mainstream party responses to such niche parties. Yet how do political parties react to issue mobilization in an institutional setting not primarily steered by electoral considerations? We argue that the European Parliament constitutes such a case and study issue competition on the radical right’s core issue: immigration. To establish the leverage of radical right members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we use an original data set of parliamentary questions and motions between 2004 and 2016. Using time-series regression analysis, we find that mainstream party groups do not increase their emphasis of immigration issues in response to radical right MEPs’ issue emphasis. These findings indicate that the institutional context and the perceived electoral threat are crucial for issue competition dynamics."
Issue Competition without Electoral Incentives? A Study of Issue Emphasis in the European Parliament,"Given the concurrent phenomena of mass incarceration and neoliberal evolutions in the welfare state, it is inevitable that criminalized women will encounter social workers in their everyday lives. Under the conceptual lens of governmentality, social workers play a central role in reinforcing and interrupting processes of criminalization. This critical discourse analysis examines knowledge production in social work as an important site of engagement with criminalized women. Findings indicate that social work privileges a psychological discourse and that the logic of risk has supplanted holistic approaches to understanding criminalized women. This, I conclude, reflects a neoliberal political climate and aligns social work with carceral institutions in troubling ways. Although the discourse of risk seems firmly entrenched in the contemporary social work lexicon, it should not be treated as infallible or inevitable. This analysis propels a shift in emphasis toward discourses that invite political and ethical engagement with the carceral state."
The Discursive Construction of Risk: Social Work Knowledge Production and Criminalized Women,"This study explores the domestic determinants of China’s intervention in the Korean War. Since the war, scholars have produced a large number of studies on the motivations behind China’s intervention in the war. These previous studies paid scant attention to domestic aspects, all of them assuming, albeit implicitly, that Party leaders could readily harness all available domestic resources and devote them to their political ends and that the public was willing to sacrifice their material resources and lives in order to satisfy the leaders’ political goals. By contrast, this study, based on extensive newly unearthed archival documents, argues that very unfavorable domestic circumstances helped shape the CCP’s strategy both before and after the outbreak of the Korean War. The domestic challenges not only provided the rationale for the CCP’s opposition to Kim Il-Sung’s Korean War plan before June 1950 but also gave an internal impetus for China’s vacillation in decision making and affected Mao’s final proactive decision to enter the war in October 1950."
Domestic Instability as a Key Factor Shaping China’s Decision to Enter the Korean War,"Political theory lacks a compelling account of public property. Addressing this gap, I present a “deep public ownership” model, according to which the body politic ultimately owns all the resources within its jurisdiction. I argue that this model is compatible with liberal intuitions regarding private property. I then contend that the model expands the scope of government’s duty to uphold the equality of all citizens, by challenging private property constraints on antidiscriminatory government policies. I anticipate the worry that the model supports excessive government intrusion into private affairs. I close by discussing abuse of public property by elected leaders."
The Idea of Public Property,"How do democratic transitions affect trade policy? A well-known finding is that transitions in developing countries produce lower tariff rates. But prior work implicitly assumes that all forms of democratic transitions are alike. There is less reason to expect trade liberalization to follow transitions led by political elites, which constitute roughly half of all democratic transitions in recent decades. Analysis of industry-level tariff rates indicates that elite-led transitions are not consistently followed by trade liberalization, while transitions initiated by the general public are associated with tariff rate reductions."
Free Trade and Forms of Democratization,"This essay draws from my ethnographic fieldwork in Northeast India and examines how identities are mediated through fermented food like bamboo shoot. These shoots come in different textures and forms: wet chunky pieces, sun-dried and stringy threads, smoked and curly strands. Our relationship with fermented food, as this essay highlights, determine how we organize, move, and order our lives, contributing to the creation of differences and alliances. At a time when we witness a global movement on fermenting cultures and the microbial world, this essay locates small-scale nonindustrial fermentation practices among communities across Northeast India. Exploring the significant role of food in shaping taste, practices, and politics on the ground, I show how fermenting cultures shape citizenship practices and identities. By highlighting narratives and representations of fermented food, this essay brings the extraordinarily varied and dense worlds of fermenting cultures and highlights the associative relationship between fermented food and communities."
Bamboo Shoot in Our Blood: Fermenting Flavors and Identities in Northeast India,"Several prominent accounts suggest that democratic transitions are more likely to take place when opposition to the incumbent regime is led by certain social groups. We further develop the argument that opposition movements dominated by industrial workers or the urban middle classes have both the requisite motivation and capacity to bring about democratization. To systematically test this argument, we collect new data on the social composition of antiregime opposition movements, globally from 1900 to 2006. We find that movements dominated by one of these urban groups more often result in democracy, both when compared to other movements and to situations without organized mass opposition. As expected, the relationship is stronger in urban than rural societies, and in more recent decades. When further differentiating the groups and accounting for plausible alternative explanations, the relationship between industrial worker campaigns and democratization is very robust, whereas the evidence is mixed for middle-class campaigns."
Who Revolts? Empirically Revisiting the Social Origins of Democracy,"Postwar environmental concern has been powerfully shaped by projections of ecological catastrophe. Indeed, it can be said that the global environment as an object of social and political concern came into existence in part through narratives of future crisis. This article explores two successive framings of environmental crisis and the kinds of knowledges that made them up. It examines the announcement of ecological limits to economic growth in the early 1970s, the culmination of an early wave of popular green concern that modeled the future as a choice between the catastrophic continuation of business as usual and the prospect of eco-utopian alternatives. It considers the crisis logics of contemporary climate dynamics, where the power of scientific modeling leaves little room for the imagination of radically different futures. Environmental crisis now cannot perform the anticipatory and utopian functions that it once did. The “apocalyptic horizon” of limits has given way to the collapse of crisis into the present and new kinds of colonization of the future. But in both cases, environmental crisis can be read as a science-fictional object, simultaneously descriptive and speculative, scientific and fictional. Science fiction tropes were crucial to early constructions of environmental crisis, and speculative climate fiction will be a vital resource for negotiating the social-natural futures of the Anthropocene."
"Environmental Futures, Now and Then: Crisis, Systems Modeling, and Speculative Fiction","After drawing parallels between the methods of mapping and those of economic modeling, this article seeks to uncover the implicit world map in J. M. Keynes’s 1933 essay “National Self-Sufficiency.” A close reading of that essay demonstrates that Keynes’s articulation of the concept of the national economy rested on a specific political-economic geography, which often obscured a view of the global and indeed imperial distribution of power and resources. The article then suggests that those epistemological and spatial assumptions helped shape the conceptual infrastructure on which subsequent models of macroeconomic intervention grew after World War II."
Keynesian Metageography and Its Afterlives,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is one of the most consequential policies enacted in recent decades, but its political divisiveness and complexity call into question whether its effects can change public opinion. Using the varied implementation of one of the ACA’s key provisions—the expansion of Medicaid—and nearly 300,000 survey responses analyzed using a difference-in-differences design, we find the expansion of Medicaid makes respondents 1.5 percentage points more positive toward the ACA and 2.2 points less likely to support repealing the ACA. Effects do not vary meaningfully by partisanship, are strongest for those most likely to be directly affected, and are stronger after the 2016 election increased the chances of repeal. In addition to highlighting the ability of partisan policies to change public opinion when credibly threatened, we demonstrate how to estimate changes in model-based group opinion without bias."
"Policy Effects, Partisanship, and Elections: How Medicaid Expansion Affected Public Opinion toward the Affordable Care Act","While (critical) information literacy (IL) acknowledges the political, economic, and social forces that shape complex information environments, library user experience (UX) typically centers efficiency and “seamlessness,” ignoring the power structures and values that condition learning. In this article, we explore the tensions between IL and UX values and practices, with the aim of starting a conversation about how these two related fields can become more closely aligned."
Make Me Think! Exploring Library User Experience through the Lens of (Critical) Information Literacy,"Is support for the US Supreme Court stable over time? Recent studies present conflicting evidence about the extent to which dissatisfaction with the Court’s performance affects its public support. Drawing on a four-year panel study of Americans’ support for the Supreme Court, we demonstrate that the Court’s support has been remarkably stable in the aggregate, although there has been systematic change at the individual level. These individual-level changes are related to respondents’ satisfaction with the Court’s performance and their political orientations. The results both confirm and challenge conventional wisdom, emphasizing the importance of studying individual-level change in attitudes even in the face of aggregate stability."
The Stability and Durability of the US Supreme Court’s Legitimacy,"Within two centuries of his death, Richard III became a vehicle for political allegory. As an epitome of tyranny, he was invoked by writers criticizing contemporary government under the veil of medieval history. In 1649, Charles I’s execution inspired parallels between the regicide Oliver Cromwell and Richard, allegedly responsible for the murder of his royal nephews. The most systematic invocation of the Wars of the Roses as a reflection of the 1640s survives in the work of a poet Thomas Wincoll (1621–1675). The life of this Cambridge-undergraduate-turned-soldier, a royalist from a puritan family whose relatives served in Cromwell’s administration, demonstrates the complex and contradictory nexus of convictions which formed the fabric of Civil War society. His only extant work, a long narrative poem, Plantagenets Tragicall Story (1649), portrays Edward IV and Richard III in a twin study of desirable and tyrannical government, and projects the fate of Charles’s wife Henrietta Maria onto Edward’s dismayed wife Elizabeth. This essay identifies the influence of Shakespeare and Thomas More on Wincoll. It reads the poem as poetical-political commentary, as well as a bold anti-Cavalier manifesto striving to redefine the ideal of a royalist poet by means of puritan virtues of piety, abstinence, and restraint. [J.Š.]"
Richard III and Regicide: Thomas Wincoll’s Plantagenets Tragicall Story (1649),"This article explores firesetting and its legal manifestation, arson, as a crucial link between girlhood, carcerality, and rage. Beginning with the North Carolina Samarcand Arson Trial of 1931, when twelve girls were charged with the capital offense of arson for burning down the Samarcand Manor State Home and Industrial Training School for Girls, an institution that incarcerated white girls during the Jim Crow era, I read historical examples of girls who set fires. In doing so, I consider firesetting as a strategy of political resistance to girls’ physical incarceration as well as what I see as the carcerality of girlhood. Additionally, I examine representations of firesetting girls from literature and film to consider how so-called match-strikers translate their rage into the calculated political act of arson as a form of anticarceral resistance to the category of girlhood itself. While I argue that the acts of firesetting are performances of anticarceral rage, representations of these “arson girls” perpetuate the suspended category of girlhood as a limiting prison of subjective boundaries enmeshed with white supremacy and class discrimination."
"Arson Girls, Match-Strikers, and Firestarters: A Reflection on Rage, Racialization, and the Carcerality of Girlhood","Five organizations exemplify organized crime organizations, or “mafias”: the American and Sicilian Cosa Nostras, the Calabrian ‘Ndrangheta, Chinese triads, and Japanese yakuza. Newer syndicates have emerged that are often called organized crime organizations but most importantly differ from the exemplars. Drug trafficking syndicates in Colombia and Mexico are large, wealthy, and extraordinarily violent but have proven fragile in the face of aggressive law enforcement, do not have fully formalized internal structures or elaborate cultures, and only occasionally attempt to exercise political power or provide dispute settlement services in the criminal world. The Primeiro Comando da Capital in Sao Paulo, originally a prisoner self-protection group, comes closer. It has a formalized internal structure and an elaborate culture that permit it partly to control drug markets and provide an alternative justice system in parts of Brazil. Rio de Janeiro’s Commando Vermelho, also originally prison-based and now extensively involved in drug trafficking, has some mafia-like characteristics. Other criminal syndicates are better thought of as “candidate criminal organizations” because they are not fully consolidated (e.g., the Neapolitan camorra), are not fully criminalized (e.g., Hells Angels), or aim mainly at political subversion and have only subsidiary involvement in profit-making crimes (e.g., the Colombian FARC)."
How Similar Are Modern Criminal Syndicates to Traditional Mafias?,"During the belle epoque, many thousands of male European citizens joined military youth groups and paramilitary units, volunteer and private police forces, company defense groups, student battalions, civic militias, and shooting clubs throughout the continent. This article investigates the features, aims, and impact of armed associations in Europe in the approximately thirty years preceding the outbreak of the First World War. The legal context within which armed associations could prosper, their involvement in strikes and in the fight against crime, and the development of patriotic armed groups are the main lines of inquiry pursued in the article. Examination of armed associationism in pre-1914 Europe, a long understudied topic, has the potential to stimulate fresh thinking on crucial aspects of modern statehood, the balance between private rights and public prerogatives, crucial forms of nationalism and patriotism, and deep-seated fears and hopes, and possibly also to shed new light on the Great War and its aftermath. The article argues that armed associationism was a specific social phenomenon with a particularly European dimension and was a response to the profound reconfigurations in social and political balances that were taking place throughout the continent."
Belle Epoque in Arms? Armed Associations and Processes of Democratization in Pre-1914 Europe,"This article explores the concept of the network as it appears in the early writing of the literary scholar Hugh Kenner. Anticipating the widespread use of network in the humanities today, Kenner adapts the term from Marshall McLuhan and uses it throughout the 1950s and ’60s to think about intellectual networks, little magazines, and academic communication. The network concept is also considered in light of Kenner’s political conservatism and his participation in the midcentury movement of conservatism."
Kenner’s Networks,"Since 9/11, scholarly work has demonstrated that Muslim Americans are viewed unfavorably, but existing measures lack enough contextual specificity to capture the unique experiences and situation of Muslims in the United States. Given the central role that Muslims and the war on terror played in the 2016 presidential campaign and election, we fill this void by introducing a new measure that focuses on Muslim Americans, specifically, and then examine its role in explaining presidential vote choice in 2016. Across five distinct surveys fielded on convenience and nationally representative samples from May 2016 to June 2017, we find that anti–Muslim American sentiment is a strong and significant predictor of supporting Trump, even when controlling for a whole host of factors. Our measure of Muslim American sentiment also more strongly and consistently predicts support for Trump, relative to previous measures of anti-Muslim sentiment."
How Negative Sentiment toward Muslim Americans Predicts Support for Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election,"Recent elections have revived the debate about the decline of social democracy, often attributed to the numerical decline in the working class and its alienation due to the mainstream left’s economically centrist and socially liberal policy stances. To explain changes in these parties’ fortunes, we instead argue that researchers need to analyze the preferences of key electoral groups on the main axes of political competition and the role of information-transmitting intermediaries in shaping these preferences. Specifically, we suggest that (1) mainstream left parties can win votes by taking up more investment-oriented positions if they (2) also take up liberal sociocultural positions and (3) do not face opposition from influential unions. We find support for these expectations using aggregate-level election results and individual-level survey responses. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of party success in advanced democracies and for empirical models of party competition more generally."
The Electoral Appeal of Party Strategies in Postindustrial Societies: When Can the Mainstream Left Succeed?,"Despite the prevalence of vote buying in many developing democracies, the evidence of its persuasive effects is very limited. This article proposes a way to evaluate the electoral impact of vote buying by using data from the 2012 presidential election in Mexico, where one of the parties distributed gift cards in exchange for support on election day. I evaluate the effect on citizens’ electoral behavior by considering voters’ proximity to the closest store where they could redeem the cards. The empirical analysis provides evidence of a persuasive effect of the gift cards, whose magnitude was positively related to precincts’ proximity to the store. The analysis also shows the local scope of this vote-buying incident on the electoral outcome, whose effect was focused on a defined group of voters. This study expands on recent theoretical accounts of parties’ targeting strategies and addresses some potential limitations in measuring the electoral consequences of vote buying."
Groceries for Votes: The Electoral Returns of Vote Buying,"Are ideologically moderate candidates more electable than ideologically extreme candidates? Historically, both research in political science and conventional wisdom answer yes to this question. However, given the rise of ideologues on both the right and the left in recent years, it is important to consider whether this assumption is still accurate. I find that, while moderates have historically enjoyed an advantage over ideologically extreme candidates in congressional elections, this gap has disappeared in recent years, where moderates and ideologically extreme candidates are equally likely to be elected. This change persists for both Democratic and Republican candidates."
Man Bites Blue Dog: Are Moderates Really More Electable than Ideologues?,"This essay focuses on the local effects and unintended consequences of the US drug war in Mexico. Mexico’s internal divisions and political challenges go beyond its role in the regional drug traffic. US drug-control policies intersected with and exacerbated many of Mexico’s domestic problems, including what activists and scholars have begun calling la guerra sucia (Dirty War), a period from the late 1950s to the early 1980s during which Mexico’s ruling party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), violently put down dissidence. Whereas a rather clean and organized image of United States–Mexico narcotics diplomacy emerges at the upper echelons of policy making, a focus on drug enforcement actors in Mexico charged with executing drug control and carrying out the PRI’s concurrent policies of domestic repression during the 1960s and 1970s reveals a very different picture. Using materials from Mexico’s Federal Security Directorate (DFS), a PRI intelligence agency, this essay demonstrates how the PRI’s actions against leftist threats shaped the Mexican government’s response to US drug issues, especially in rural, drug-producing areas already prone to political instability. As drug enforcement collided with the PRI’s efforts at domestic repression, it empowered certain state actors at the expense of others and led to a number of violent abuses."
Mexico’s Dirty War on Drugs: Source Control and Dissidence in Drug Enforcement,"In the second half of the twentieth century, Indigenous populations from different parts of the world were identified as key subjects in a wide range of investigations into patterns of human biological variation. Focusing on Amazonia, a prominent region for such research, this paper explores some of the complex relationships between biomedicine, anthropological knowledge, political regimes, and Indigenous rights. We focus on the roles of Francis L. Black (Yale University) and James V. Neel (University of Michigan), leading American scientists working in lowland South America from the 1970s to the 1990s, in knowledge production and scientific disputes at the intersection of human biology and susceptibility to infectious diseases, as well as the use of specific biomedical technologies (e.g., vaccines). During the Cold War, arguments concerning genetically determined susceptibility to infectious diseases and the role of biomedicine in health care for Indigenous populations became highly disputed, as scientists were concerned about how scientific knowledge could be used in the implementation of public policies. We argue that analysis of unpublished debates about the political implications of the trajectory of biomedical research about Amazonian Indigenous peoples helps to broaden and complexify the global history of human biological diversity research in the post–World War II period."
“Why Did They Die?”: Biomedical Narratives of Epidemics and Mortality among Amazonian Indigenous Populations in Sociohistorical and Anthropological Contexts,"The recent global financial crisis has been a serious stress test for representative democracies. Voter support has supposedly become more volatile, fragmented, and polarized, leaving elites with an intricate mix of economic and political challenges. However, a closer look at a new data set of European party systems during three major crises (1929, 1973, and 2008) reveals that the reality is less dramatic than the popular impression suggests. We propose a novel theory of party-system change that explains both the impact of economic crises as well as the robustness of party systems to more serious destabilization. Since voters and elites are risk averse, economic crises tend to disturb party systems that are generally “restrained” but, at the same time, help consolidate more complex systems. This explains why party systems rarely fall apart, nor do they reach ultimate stability. We provide quantitative evidence and qualitative illustrations of “restrained change” in various party-system dimensions."
Restrained Change: Party Systems in Times of Economic Crisis,"A typical discussion of judicial review pits the view of Alexander Hamilton in Federalist no. 78 (protection from the “cabals of a representative body”) against the much more circumscribed view of Justice Owen Roberts (“lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and decide whether the latter squares with the former”). This tension between two views informs much of the current debate over judicial review. But the “tension” is illusory; the real problem can be analyzed as a two-dimensional spatial problem, with participants having preferences over both the substantive issue being litigated and the principle of judicial review in the abstract. This article presents a set of results based on such a spatial analysis and considers an answer to the apparent paradox that judicial review may prevail against political majorities for long periods. Furthermore, the results from the model indicate that any purely issue-oriented “median voter” approach to court voting is misspecified and will lead to incorrect predictions."
A Stream That Rises above Its Source: Judicial Review from a Public Choice Perspective,This article validates donation-based measures of ideology against a rich battery of policy items from the Congressional Campaign Election Study. Donation-based measures are powerful predictors of policy preferences for a wide range of issues and successfully discriminate between donors from the same party. The overall predictive accuracy and relative improvement over party are comparable to what is achieved by scaling roll call votes in legislatures. The results add to an existing body of evidence on the internal validity and reliability of donation-based measures. They also resolve a standing debate in the literature over whether political donations are a valid indicator of donors’ policy preferences.
Are Donation-Based Measures of Ideology Valid Predictors of Individual-Level Policy Preferences?,"Divination shapes the central political concerns of Julius Caesar in ways that scholars have not appreciated while drawing on some of the epistemological dissonance of early modern natural philosophy. Divination also contributes to a typological structure in which the fall of Julius Caesar gives rise to the Roman Empire under Octavius “Augustus” Caesar, whose peaceful rule in turn establishes the conditions in which Christianity emerges. In subjecting signs of divination to theatrical representation—to embodied movement, dialogue, and musical performance—Shakespeare transforms the cognitive dissonance of early modern natural philosophy, especially in efforts to discern the Book of Nature, into aesthetic signs that can be received and interpreted by playgoers. Shakespeare’s tragedy attempts to realize the inexpressible through performance while depending on an ambiguous system of signs in which human action and thought remain both unfathomable and unknown."
"Shakespeare’s “Monstrous State”: Divination, Typology, and the Book of Nature in Julius Caesar","On March 24, 2018, more than 2 million people participated in the March for Our Lives, a nationwide student-led demonstration held to protest gun violence and support gun control legislation following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The March for Our Lives, which the Associated Press has called “one of the biggest youth protests since Vietnam,” captured the fearless outrage and awakened energies of American youth. Students of all genders and backgrounds took part in the march, yet popular media outlets often identified girl activists, and in particular Emma González, as the true leaders of the gun control movement. Based on a critical reading of González’s public speeches and mainstream media representation, this article explores the perils and possibilities associated with public feminism when teenage girls do this critical work. I argue that González circulates across media sites in three intertextual ways: as a celebrity leader, a media spectacle, and a cautionary tale for girls who push too far beyond the boundaries of normative girlhood. By documenting the push and pull of González’s hypervisibility, the article considers the ways in which narratives of exceptional girlhood accumulate around and in turn shape her activism and public address. González’s resistance to repeated positioning as a girl-power feminist, coupled with her struggle to maintain her voice and vision as her own, illustrates the complexities of public feminism as a world-making process. Reading González as a public feminist intellectual allows us to see how girls engaged in projects of resistance grapple with competing demands on their political lives."
This Is Not Another Girl-Power Story: Reading Emma González as a Public Feminist Intellectual,"This paper synthesizes recent archaeological research on the Kingdom of Haiti, a short-lived experiment in political sovereignty founded in the years following the Haitian Revolution. I will explore the potential for an archaeology of sovereignty in the Black Atlantic world. Examining both architectural spaces and artifacts recovered from the palace of Sans-Souci, royal residence of King Henry Christophe, this paper highlights a constellation of material practices that fostered an emerging ideology of authority in postrevolution Haiti. Collectively, this research is revealing how political agents drew creatively and strategically from both European material culture and Afro-Caribbean traditions in the practice of political authority in the Kingdom of Haiti, casting new light on the complex nature of sovereignty after slavery in the Age of Revolutions."
Sovereignty after Slavery: Universal Liberty and the Practice of Authority in Postrevolutionary Haiti,"This essay focuses on the voters of Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro in Morro da Cruz, a low-income community in Porto Alegre. The transition from Lulism (2002–16) to Bolsonarism (2018–) was marked by the rise and fall of the economy and the collapse of the political system. Based on a ten-year longitudinal ethnography, we look at the effects of such major shifts at the national level on people’s individual self- and political subjectivity. We investigate how and why “new consumers”—those who accessed the finance system during the Workers’ Party (PT) Administration—came to support a far-right candidate. We argue that the inclusion of the poor into the market economy brought about individual empowerment and a sense of self-worth in the PT era—a process that was threatened by economic recession and unleashed an existential crisis, especially among men. Bolsonaro, as a male figure, and his campaign gave order to a changing world, resulting in a reconciliation of personhood and political belonging."
From hope to hate: The rise of conservative subjectivity in Brazil,"Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” has been canonized as an essential statement of the political theory of civil disobedience. This article examines the early reception of King’s essay and the development of the liberal idea of civil disobedience it has become synonymous with to argue that its canonization coincided with, and displaced, the radicalization of King’s developing thinking about disobedience. It examines published and archival writings from 1965 through 1968 to reconstruct King’s power-oriented theory of “mass” civil disobedience as it developed in response to the dual challenges of white backlash and Black Power. The basic challenge of mass civil disobedience is how to mobilize liberating acts of taking power without undercutting the possibility of transformative integration through sharing power. To articulate this dilemma, this article draws on an undertheorized category from John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice to conceptualize disobedience as a practice of militant love."
"Power for the Powerless: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Late Theory of Civil Disobedience","Kexue xiangsheng (science crosstalk) features comic dialogues aimed at popularizing knowledge in the physical and social sciences. This genre emerged in the late 1950s in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as part of a massive effort in the state-supervised culture industry to promote science. The genre shared many of the hallmarks of PRC instrumentalist science fiction, as both were based on a Soviet model. Authors and literary theorists like Guo Moruo, Ye Yonglie, and Gu Junzheng reiterated developmental narratives of socialism and of the power of science as a tool for mastery of nature developed by authors like Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Il’in. These works of socialist realism narrated transformations in the consciousness of their characters as they came to understand guiding principles of the world around them, including basic science, evolution, and dialectical materialism. Dramatic forms like kexue xiangsheng worked in concert with other socialist-realist representative modes, including popular performance, reportage, fiction, film, song, and reappropriations of premodern literary forms. In the process, notions of scientific thinking were conflated with political orthodoxy in promoting public health and political campaigns, and science was dismantled as a professional institution, shifting from a rationalized bureaucratic endeavor to grassroots efforts aimed at solving pragmatic problems. Through education in what I term the “quotidian utopian”—small health and hygiene measures that had the potential to ameliorate major health challenges—these popular science genres also straddled the line between Frederic Jameson’s “Utopian form and Utopian wish,” between what was part utopian text and part expression of the impulse to enact utopia through changes in policy and reconfigurations of the collective body."
Locating Kexue Xiangsheng (Science Crosstalk) in Relation to the Selective Tradition of Chinese Science Fiction,"Francis Lieber (1800–1872), professor at South Carolina College and Columbia College, New York City, spent his career grappling with the nature of political organization. A German émigré, Lieber’s political theory of the state grew around a critique of social contract theory, which he believed fostered a “Gallican liberty” prone to centralization and democratic absolutism. He contrasted this tradition with one premised on a healthy “Anglican liberty” that diffused power through societal institutions and cooperative government structures. This transatlantic perspective informed Lieber’s response to the primary threats confronting the American political system at midcentury: Calhounite states’ rights theory and Democrats’ amoral understanding of “popular sovereignty,” both of which opened the door for slavery’s expansion. Preserving institutional liberty and the Union led Lieber to a full-throated defense of the United States as an organic nation-state capable of squashing secession and advancing civilization and freedom through constitutional reform and international law."
"Francis Lieber on Institutional Liberty, Secession, and the Modern State","House deliberations over healthcare legislation in 1798 show members of the Fifth US Congress debating the constitutional basis of small government assumptions about states’ rights and federal power, asking why the regime’s principles should not be understood as requiring direct federal intervention in the lives of socially and economically vulnerable groups irrespective of states’ authority. Extending the current scholarly debate over nationalization and state building in early American thought, I suggest that questions alleged by many scholars to have been excluded from political and constitutional debate in the early republic were, in cases like this, robustly contested."
Support for Nationalization and State Building in the Early American Republic: The Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen,"Police use of force bears on central matters of political science, including equality of citizen treatment by government. In light of recent high-profile officer-involved shootings (OIS) that resulted in civilian deaths, we assess whether, conditional on a shooting, a civilian’s race predicts fatality during police-civilian interactions. We combine Los Angeles data on OIS with a novel research design to estimate the causal effects of fatal shootings on citizen-initiated contact with government. Specifically, we examine whether fatal OIS affect citizen contact with the municipal government via use of the emergency 911 and nonemergency 311 call systems in Los Angeles. We find no average effect of OIS on patterns of 911 and 311 call behavior across a wide range of empirical specifications. Our results suggest, contrary to existing evidence, that OIS, in and of themselves, do not substantively change civic behavior, at least not citizen-initiated contact with local government."
Do Officer-Involved Shootings Reduce Citizen Contact with Government?,"The precepts of Bulgarian Stalinist philosopher Todor Pavlov’s internationally recognized Theory of Reflection held almost absolute sway in Bulgaria reducing to silence other views on aesthetics, including those of Marxists such as Lukács and Adorno. In the early 1960s a young assistant professor, Isaac Passy, challenged those precepts in a forceful and hazardous confrontation with Pavlov’s authority. The article explores the theoretical and political stakes of the clash."
Subverting the Theory of Reflection: Modernism against “Modern Realism”,"South Carolina’s electoral politics provided unique venues for Black empowerment during Reconstruction. Though largely overlooked in the historiography, the state’s flagship institution, the University of South Carolina, was a crucial piece of its Reconstruction philosophy. By 1868, legislators and university trustees radically altered their approach to higher education by expanding student scholarships and declaring it was a “tuition-free” institution open to all, regardless of race or class. These adjustments allowed Black men to matriculate by 1873, and they eventually comprised the majority of students until it was resegregated in 1877. This article reviews the Reconstruction government’s policies toward educational equality, the public response to the governmental shifts, and how students viewed their time at the institution. I reveal how African American politics in South Carolina directly intersected with educational concerns throughout the Reconstruction period. I conclude the essay by exploring how this historical moment was remembered or denied by subsequent generations."
The Radical Experiment of South Carolina: The History and Legacy of a Reconstructed University,"The ethnographic focus of this paper is a group of sourdough bakers based in Finland, with a specific view on a fermentation workshop in 2019. In this workshop, emerging human-microbe relations were drawn, bringing attention to a post-antibiotic world. Studying bread making necessitates a more-than-human analysis that foregrounds microbes as central characters situated in the political climate of increasing populism and the Anthropocene. In this paper I describe bakers, termed microbiohackers, putting forward critiques of capitalism that link ecological extraction, political oppression, and industrial food production. Crafting an alternative to the dominant public health narrative of microbes as a threat and antimicrobial resistance, I use the notion of diffraction to discuss the complex entanglements of the microbial/material and social/political. In the hands of the bakers, fermentation, sourdough, and antimicrobial resistance present an opportunity to question dualisms of how microbes are thought about and to create emergent post-antibiotic futures."
Fermentation in Post-antibiotic Worlds: Tuning In to Sourdough Workshops in Finland,"The Yale Reports of 1828 are one of the most important documents in American higher education. They established the parameters of liberal education for much of the nineteenth century. Scholars have argued over whether the reports looked to the past or the future. This essay argues that the Yale Reports inaugurated a new era for the humanities and American liberal education. By publishing their ideas and subjecting them to the give and take of public opinion, Yale’s officers and faculty members recognized that, in a democracy, citizens would determine the value of liberal education, rather than the other way around. The Yale Reports thus signified a transformation in the epistemological foundations of liberal education. In a democratic society, advocates would need to make a case for liberal education before an already-enfranchised citizenry. In short, with the Yale Reports, the humanities entered a new historical phase, in which they would be tested by, but also contribute to, democratic culture and politics."
Liberal Education Confronts the Rise of Democracy: Yale’s Reports of 1828,"This article argues that Tocqueville considered pantheism as the theoretical foundation of two types of democratic despotism: the omnipotence of “the majority” as an intellectual effect of pantheism, and administrative centralization as a political effect, such as that found in Saint-Simonianism. Focusing on Tocqueville’s critical views against the thirst for “pan” or the passion for unity in postrevolutionary French publications, this article sheds new light on Tocqueville’s theory of democratic despotism, which became a more passionate, even religious idea in the second volume of Democracy in America. Contrasting Tocqueville’s discussion of pantheism with the analyses of certain Catholic thinkers, it also argues that Tocqueville defended a form of individualism against pantheism’s threat to individual liberties."
Tocqueville on Pantheism: The Theory of Democratic Despotism,"This paper examines corporations’ actions, and statements about actions, following the tax law change known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Specifically, we examine four different outcomes: bonuses (or other actions that benefit workers), announcements of new investments, share repurchases, and dividend announcements. We find that 4% of public firms in our sample announced in the first quarter of 2018 they would pay some portion of their tax savings toward workers. In terms of investment, we find that 22% of the S&P 500 firms in our sample mentioned in earnings conference calls that they would increase investment because of the TCJA. We find a general increase in share repurchases following the passage of the TCJA, but the increase is extremely concentrated in a small number of firms. We find only nine firms that announced a new share repurchase plan explicitly attributed the new plan to the TCJA. In regression analysis, we find that both political and economic variables explain TCJA-linked announcements. The analysis suggests that firms with greater expected tax savings from the TCJA are those most likely to announce payments to workers and plans to increase investment. Firms with a political action committee that donates more to Republican candidates are also more likely to announce benefits to employees."
Who Do Voter ID Laws Keep from Voting?,"Voter identification (ID) laws have sparked concerns of vote suppression, but existing evidence relies on aggregate analyses or survey self-reports. We leverage unique information from Texas, where registrants without ID filed “reasonable impediment declarations” (RIDs) before voting. Linking 16,000 RID forms to the Texas voter file, we provide the first direct documentation of the traits of voters who would be stopped from voting under strict identification laws. Our preregistered analysis finds registrants voting without ID in 2016 were disproportionately Black and Latinx when compared to voters voting with ID. Examining voters’ stated reasons for not providing ID, we find socioeconomic hardships are not the most commonly cited impediment, but voters with hardships were less likely to vote in a strict-ID election than those who previously had identification. Our findings indicate that strict identification laws will stop a disproportionately minority, otherwise-willing set of registered voters from voting."
Tax Reform Made Me Do It!,"This paper examines corporations’ actions, and statements about actions, following the tax law change known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Specifically, we examine four different outcomes: bonuses (or other actions that benefit workers), announcements of new investments, share repurchases, and dividend announcements. We find that 4% of public firms in our sample announced in the first quarter of 2018 they would pay some portion of their tax savings toward workers.

"Delegation, Collaborative Governance, and Nondistributive Policy: The Curious Case of Joint Partnerships in American Federalism","Although Congress often uses grants and other fiscal incentives when delegating policy to the states, it also incorporates nonfiscal arrangements, or joint partnerships, into legislation. These partnerships include joint state-federal oversight boards, intergovernmental task forces, as well as other nondistributive programs and services. We examine the conditions under which Congress chooses to increase joint partnerships in a formal model of intergovernmental delegation and test the implications of the model on federal laws from 1973 to 2010. We argue with evidence that Congress may rely on collaborative nonfiscal partnerships with states and localities when technical uncertainty increases but is less likely to do so when political uncertainty rises. Our theory extends existing models of delegation to provide an important step toward a broader theory of legislatively designed collaborative governance."
Aristotle on the Preservation of Tyranny,"A famous matter of controversy in the Politics is the fact that Aristotle elaborates on two ways to preserve a tyranny while he simultaneously holds it to be the worst of regimes. In this note I argue that Aristotle uses these two modes of preservation to indicate that tyranny is not necessarily a regime without the consent of the ruled, as it is traditionally understood by his predecessors, for he seems to believe that a tyrant can rule willing subjects as well."
Blood Is Thicker than Water: Family Size and Leader Deposition in Medieval and Early Modern Europe,"Are large families a liability or an asset for an autocratic ruler? In this article, we show that in medieval and early modern Europe, relatives protected monarchs from challenges from their elite groups, thus reducing their risk of being deposed. Women reduced the risk of both depositions from outside and from within the family, whereas men primarily reduced the risk of outside depositions (as well as the risk of civil wars breaking out). This is demonstrated in a statistical analysis of 27 European monarchies spanning the time period 1000–1799, which enlists new data on royal offspring, siblings, and paternal uncles and aunts. These findings not only elucidate power dynamics in the medieval and early modern world of dynastic politics but also have implications for present-day authoritarian states where institutions are weak and personal relationships retain their importance."
Migratory Dissemblance,"Darlene Clark Hine’s “Rape and Inner Lives of Black Women in the Middle West” has been essential to black feminist theorizing of African American women’s history, respectability politics, and sexuality. However, it has not been understood as offering a political theory that has implications for understanding gendered migration. The global history of migration is shaped by both continuity and rupture. Slavery, imperialism, colonialism, and capitalism have shaped the modern world, and their impact on communities continues today. And yet the specificity of certain moments of immigration and migration history should not be elided. But what happens if Hine’s theoretical framing of African American women’s migration and the idea of the culture of dissemblance are placed at the center of our understandings of the workings of citizenship and power in the United States, or practices of agency among migrant women? This essay argues that Hine’s essay should be placed in conversation with histories of migration and immigration, as African American migration and shifts in immigration policy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries shaped labor in the United States. Her idea of a “culture of dissemblance” leads us to the idea of migratory dissemblance—a response by migrating women to the disclosure requirements of communities, employers, and the state, which demand honesty but often punish a person for revealing victimization when attempting to cross geographic borders for greater freedom or survival."
Representation on the Periphery: The Past and Future of Nonvoting Members of Congress,"Nonvoting representatives, representing American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Washington, DC, inhabit a peripheral space within the US Congress. House rules bar them from voting on the floor, their authority derives not from the Constitution but from statute, and the office they hold can be revoked at the whims of Congress. Drawing on original archival research, this article sketches out three justifications given for this institution: that nonvoting members would increase information flows to the legislature, that they would incorporate peripheral territory prior to statehood, and that they would empower members to use tools besides voting to exercise political power. It then evaluates the normative status of nonvoting representation in democratic theory, arguing that representation without voting is incongruent with notions of consent and equal power required for democratic self-rule."
"Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and the Future of the Republican Party and Conservatism in America","Ronald Reagan is one of the most consequential presidents of the twentieth century. He was a leader of the conservative movement that displaced the Republican Party’s liberal-moderate faction and established conservatism as the prevailing ideology of the Party and as an influential force in American politics. He is also viewed as an uncompromising, principled ideological purist who won the cold war, but also as a racist and white supremacist. The three books reviewed in this essay consider each of these aspects of Reagan’s legacy. The essay ends with a discussion of the relationship of “Trumpism” to the Reagan legacy."
"In the Path of the Black Panther: Science, Technology, and Speculative Fiction in African Studies","Drawing on Marvel’s Black Panther and the work of the authors Nnedi Okorafor, Tade Thompson, and Deji Olukotun, this article argues that African-oriented speculative fiction resonates with major narratives in the social study of science and technology in Africa. They depict the erasure of African expertise by hegemonic understandings of science and technology, illustrate historically specific meanings of the cultural categories of science and technology, and challenge conventional approaches to the distinction between magic and technology and the politics of temporality. Although always partial and situated, speculative fiction offers incisive analyses of science and technology in Africa."
Self-Enforcing Partisan Procedures,"Using a multistage model of collective decision making, we study how partisan polarization in legislatures affects the initial choice and future revision of procedural rules. We analyze how a legislature allocates proposal power over policy decisions under uncertainty about the future polarization in policy preferences among legislators. Our notion of polarization encompasses both intra- and interparty heterogeneity in policy preferences. We show that majority procedures are partisan and self-enforcing, that is, survive future revisions even though they concentrate proposal power in the hands of a few (nonmedian) majority party members. This leads to systematic promajority policy bias. Increased polarization, however, may not increase the concentration of proposal power within the majority party. The model provides a unified analytical framework to evaluate a long-standing debate about the foundations of partisan influence in the US Congress."
"A Real State of Exception: Class Composition and Social Conflict during Portugal’s Carnation Revolution, 1974–1975","This article addresses the topic of workers’ struggles in Portugal during the revolutionary process of 1974–75. Departing from a critical dialogue with classic social movements theory and the contentious politics research agenda, it is an attempt to formulate an alternative theoretical framework for the interpretation of social conflicts, inspired in reflections developed by Walter Benjamin and hypotheses elaborated within Italian workerism (operaismo). Instead of looking at collective action merely as a sideshow, or a consequence of processes taking place elsewhere, the article calls for a discussion on if and how social conflicts are able to shape the conditions under which “elites” compete and state authority is enforced, using the Portuguese Revolution as a field of inquiry into subjects such as agency, causality, sovereignty, and class."
“They Should Have Never Given Us Uniforms If They Didn’t Want Us to Be an Army”: The Handmaid’s Tale as Transmedia Feminism,"Even prior to its premier in April 2017, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale inspired a series of cosplay protests against antiabortion legislation at the Texas State Capitol. The red robes and white bonnets have since been popularized by the critically acclaimed series, and handmaid-style cosplay protests have continued transnationally, with the handmaid heralded as what the BBC calls “an international protest symbol” against heteropatriarchal oppression. Due to a surge of visible feminisms in popular media, it has become good business to create such female-centric, avowedly feminist texts. As the television industry has evolved from a broadcast network to a subscription market, content options have emerged that have both cultivated and responded to a feminist niche audience. Industry interests and feminist interests have seemingly aligned, with the adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale representing a pertinent example of the popular and the political intersecting. The Handmaid’s Tale has been positioned by both industry and audience as a transmedia text that bridges fiction and reality to become part and parcel of contemporary feminist movements. This article will thus make an argument for how the shifting television landscape might enable new forms of public feminisms. Through a case study of The Handmaid’s Tale, I will examine how transnational feminist communities might mobilize around such texts and how fiction and fan activities might be used to embolden feminist political action."
Incorporation: Governing Gendered Violence in a State of Disempowerment,"Gender and legal scholars argue that law enforcement personnel govern gendered violence by selectively protecting “good victims” and imposing social control. This article shows why these theories are not universally applicable. Using 26 months of participant observation and interview data with law enforcement personnel in the state of West Bengal, India, this article identifies an alternate set of governmental practices termed incorporation. Law enforcement personnel incorporated women by reassigning casework and encouraging extralegal repossessions and punishment. This governmental model rewarded women with organizational connections, not women who were “good victims.” And instead of expanding state control, it delegated authority to civilians. These findings underscore how low enforcement capacity and political mobilization influence the way law enforcement governs gendered violence in a postcolonial, developing context."
Gender Irrelevance: How Women and Men Rationalize Their Support for the Right,"Right-wing groups have generally been considered gender-conservative or, in some instances, sexist. Given this background, it is a puzzle why young people, particularly women with relatively liberal gender attitudes, support these groups. This article tries to answer this question by comparing men’s and women’s justifications for participation in nativist and antimigration political groups. It develops the concept of gender irrelevance, defined as the processes and strategies through which members of these groups render male dominance and gender segregation trivial within their organizations; the sexist behaviors of some group members tolerable; and concerns about gender inequalities unimportant, secondary, and ultimately irrelevant in their decisions to support these groups. The article further illustrates the strategies of gender irrelevance, which include the misrepresentation, naturalization, individualization, and universalization of gender inequality and biases; the construction and deployment of the twin discourses of female privilege and male disadvantage; the tendency to compartmentalize gender biases; the argument of compromising gender; and criticism against an allegedly exaggerated, inconsistent, and double-standard feminism. The research concerns Hong Kong’s young and educated supporters of nativist and antimigration political groups. They are political minorities in relation to the omnipresent Chinese state but majorities at home in relation to mainland Chinese immigrants whom they construct as the other. We believe that the concept of gender irrelevance is applicable to other contexts and not merely to these young people in Hong Kong. It has the potential to help us understand the global rise of the Right."
Inequality Growth and Economic Policy Liberalism: An Updated Test of a Classic Theory,"Long-standing political economy theory argues that increases in economic inequality will increase public demand for liberal economic policy. Empirical support for this proposition is relatively inconsistent, though, with the result being uncertainty about the validity of the theory. Since the inception of such theory, however, scholarship has rendered new insights about how to conceptualize the most theoretically plausible measure of exposure to inequality. In contrast to prior work, which largely focuses on citizens’ responses to what may now be viewed as an implausible measure, national-level inequality, this article focuses on what this literature suggests to be a more plausible measure: inequality growth in citizens’ local context. Using national panel data, this article offers a theoretically updated and more rigorous test of the redistributive democracy hypothesis. The results demonstrate that drastic increases in local income inequality are associated with increasing support for liberal economic policy."
When Time Is of the Essence: A Natural Experiment on How Time Constraints Influence Elections,"Foundational theories of voter turnout suggest that time is a key input in the voting decision, but we possess little causal evidence about how this resource affects electoral behavior. In this article, we use over two decades of elections data and a novel geographic regression discontinuity design that leverages US time zone boundaries. Our results show that exogenous shifts in time allocations have significant political consequences. Namely, we find that citizens are less likely to vote if they live on the eastern side of a time zone border. Time zones also exacerbate participatory inequality and push election results toward Republicans. Exploring potential mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that these effects are the consequence of insufficient sleep and moderated by the convenience of voting. Regardless of the exact mechanisms, our results indicate that local differences in daily schedules affect how difficult it is to vote and shape the composition of the electorate."
"Trilingual Blunders: Signboards, Social Media, and Transnational Sri Lankan Tamil Publics","In Sri Lanka all public signs are required by law to be in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. This article investigates the multiple, clashing ways that Sri Lankan Tamil speakers (Tamils and Muslims) living in-country and abroad interpret Tamil signage blunders in relation to the position of ethnic minorities in the postwar nation. I incorporate ethnographic interviews to examine how three Tamil speakers made sense of a signboard, displayed in several government buses in Colombo, in which the Tamil portion read “reserved for pregnant dogs” instead of “reserved for pregnant mothers.” I situate their responses in an account of the circulation of Tamil signage errors on Facebook. I argue that Tamil speakers’ disparate interpretations reflect contrasting semiotic ideologies concerning the intentionality of the blunders and the relationship between the posted signboard images and lived sociolinguistic practices (Keane 2003, 2018), which have implications for imagined postwar futures and transnational Tamil political activism."
"With All Deliberate Speed: The Reversal of Court-Ordered School Desegregation, 1970–2013","The retrenchment of court-ordered school desegregation has been more variable and incomplete than often acknowledged, challenging common accounts that blame changes in federal policy and legal precedent. This study supplements these accounts by examining local factors that influenced whether and when desegregation orders were dismissed between 1970 and 2013. After accounting for federal policy changes and districts’ variable success in desegregating schools, several ostensibly race-neutral organizational, financial, and political incentives appear to influence the survival of desegregation orders. Racial competition dynamics related to local racial composition also seem to play a role, as desegregation orders have been most vulnerable when and where black population shares surpass a tipping point of about 40%."
Feminist Blind Spots and the Affect of Secularity: Disorienting the Discourse of the Veil in Contemporary Morocco,"Based on extensive fieldwork with founding members of the Moroccan feminist movement who come out of a leftist political tradition, this article provides an ethnography of leftist feminist aversion toward the hijab (modern headscarf) in contemporary Morocco. I situate the preoccupation with the hijab among Moroccan secular feminists within a broader affective economy and civilizational discourse about the veil that contributes to its intensity and tenacity. I argue that this incitement to discourse about the hijab conscripts Moroccan secular-leftist feminists into a global moral panic that prevents them from engaging with veiled and nonsecular women on their own (diverse) terms or being in solidarity with them. It also keeps them conveniently invested in the Orientalist idea that feminism in places like Morocco requires vigilance against the threat of religion and tradition rather than the conscripting logics of colonialism, capitalism, and neoliberalism. In doing so, I suggest that the discourse of the veil not only perpetuates notions of Western superiority and makes lives less livable for Muslim minorities in the West, it also keeps postcolonial feminists embroiled in the Western battle of the veil and estranged from each other."
Pressures on Chinese Judges under Xi,"Drawing on interviews with Chinese judges, this paper reveals the major effects of judicial reforms during the past half decade. It focuses on the ramifications of a new quota and responsibility system for judges and on the strengthening of central-government controls over the judiciary. The paper differentiates between what the Party considers to be legitimate and illegitimate influences on judges, which sheds light on recent legal developments and the role of the judiciary in Chinese governance. The article finds that illegitimate influences on courts have declined palpably, but what the Party perceives to be legitimate influences have persisted and even been reinforced. More direct, comprehensive control over judges has replaced previously fragmented, multilayered mechanisms. Despite important changes, the reforms did not lead to institutional independence of Chinese judges, nor has the stature of the courts in China’s political landscape changed."
Democracy versus Neoliberalism: The Second Dewey-Lippmann Debate,"The original 1920s debate between John Dewey and Walter Lippmann concerned whether the modern electorate can meaningfully engage in democratic self-rule rather than be ruled by technocratic experts. Less well known is the further disagreement between these two thinkers sparked by Lippmann’s 1937 book The Good Society. This work was seminal for the development of free market neoliberalism and is linked to both F. A. Hayek’s 1944 The Road to Serfdom and the founding of the Mont Pelerin Society. The core of Lippmann’s political theory is a liberal conception of the rule of law as the framework for the competitive market and a constraint on the democratic state. Dewey, fierce critic of capitalism, harshly reviewed Lippmann’s book, insisting on democratic control of the economy, though he failed to satisfactorily specify how that would work. This second Dewey-Lippmann debate is a forerunner of current theoretical disputes over the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy."
"Immigration, Voting Rights, and Redistribution: Evidence from Local Governments in Europe","How does immigration influence local redistributive spending? This is a salient question in Europe, where local governments exercise discretion over social policy. Although prevailing accounts predict that anti-immigrant sentiment will fuel cuts in social spending, this perspective overlooks institutional variation in foreign voting rights. Building on the literature on democracy and redistribution, this article argues that an immigration-induced “race to the bottom” in local social expenditure will be conditional on the political status granted to foreign residents. Where foreign residents possess voting rights, incumbents gain incentives to leverage redistributive transfers to mobilize immigrant votes, offsetting downward pressure on social spending. To test the argument, the analysis draws on municipal-level panel data from nine European countries and implements a difference-in-differences design within two recent cases of franchise extension. The results indicate that the extension of local voting rights is sufficient to reverse downward bias in social spending within diversifying localities."
The Maintenance of Institutional Legitimacy in Supreme Court Justices’ Public Rhetoric,"Judicial politics scholars routinely posit that the behavior of Supreme Court justices is motivated in important part by concerns of institutional maintenance, that is, by a desire to maintain the Court’s unusually large store of institutional legitimacy. Previous work on this topic, however, has focused almost exclusively on the influence of such motivation on judicial decision making. We contend that if institutional maintenance is an important goal, it should be observable in other contexts as well. We examine televised mass-media interviews with Supreme Court justices from 1998 to 2016 and find that legitimacy reinforcement is the predominant goal reflected in justices’ rhetoric in those interviews."
Low Intensities,"This essay opens with one of hundreds of massacres carried out in the early 1980s in Guatemala by agents of the military state. The killing was meant to depopulate the Rio Negro valley to make way for a hydroelectric dam. Like much of the violence of the 36-year conflict, it was low-tech and carried out by civil patrollers, which is perhaps why the Guatemalan civil war was considered a “low intensity conflict” by US Army definitions: “below conventional war… employing political, economic, informational, and military instruments.” I suggest that these instruments encompass what many anthropologists call culture. While beginning with a moment of spectacular violence, the essay then traces the mundane, everyday political and economic embeddings of militarism into Guatemalan social institutions, life, conditions of possibility, meaning systems, and abilities to affect and be affected. A history of the present, it traces the paramilitarization of the army/government in the 1960s and 1970s via the development of death squads and other clandestine bodies and illicit networks that shape state functioning today. Yet it also explores the intensities of countercultures of militarism, the networks that have forced perpetrator accountability, reparations, and state recognition of Mayan peoples and their rights to defend their territories from accumulation by dispossession."
Negotiated Marketization: Public Universities and Higher Education Markets in Peru (1990–2014),"Higher education marketization has often been explained either by state weakness or by the articulation capacity of business actors. However, these perspectives overlook the role of other actors in the negotiation processes determining the results of these reforms. Like other countries of the Global South, Peru experienced a radical marketization process throughout the 1990s. Previous studies have presented this case as an example of a radical expansion of for-profit universities, neglecting the organizational capacity of public universities. Drawing on the literature on economic sociology and social movements, this article examines the political strategies of several public university presidents throughout the marketization process. Through the systematic analysis of legal documents and media reports, as well as through interviews with key actors, this article traces the marketization process in detail, showing how public universities gained autonomy and were able to shape the process of marketization."
The Welfare State with Private Alternatives: The Transformation of Popular Support for Social Insurance,"Private alternatives to the public provision of welfare state services and benefits have expanded in almost all OECD countries over the past decades. In this paper, we study how this change affects patterns of public support for the welfare state and, in the long term, the political sustainability of solidaristic social policies. Our core argument is that the availability of private alternatives undermines support for public provision of social insurance policies, in particular among the middle and upper-income classes, whose political support is crucial for the political viability of the universalist welfare state regime. We test our theoretical claim empirically with survey data from the ISSP Role of Government module for 20 OECD countries."
Biased Judgments without Biased Judges: How Legal Institutions Cause Errors,"Certain features of the legal system, such as litigant-driven appeals and random assignment of judges to cases, are supposed to prevent biased and error-prone decision-making by judges. I analyze a formal model illustrating this is not always true, even when judges are personally unbiased. First, an unbiased trial judge may make systematically biased judgments when that judge’s decisions can be appealed by a losing litigant. If the judge is sufficiently reversal averse, this bias favors higher resource litigants. Second, litigant-driven appeals allow unbiased judges to put less effort into resolving cases correctly. Third, when unbiased judges are assigned randomly to cases, they will produce more errors than a case assignment system allowing trial judges more freedom to select cases. The results confirm one contention of “team models” of judicial hierarchy (that litigant behavior is important) while also demonstrating the limits of another (that judicial hierarchies minimize adjudication errors)."
Valence Attacks Harm the Electoral Performance of the Left but Not the Right,"During election campaigns, parties attack each other’s nonideological traits such as competence and integrity. However, it is unclear to what extent valence attacks reduce voter support for the target party. Drawing from theories on left-right personality and associated cognitive flexibility, we argue that valence attacks harm the electoral performance of leftist but not rightist parties. The relative openness of leftist voters makes them more willing to accept negative information about their party and act on it. In contrast, the relative closedness of rightist voters makes them less likely to reconsider their political preferences in the face of negative information. We find robust evidence for our argument at the aggregate and individual levels, using original data on media coverage of party campaigns in 10 European countries. We also provide experimental evidence in support of our argument. The findings have important implications for research on nonideological rhetoric in party competition."
"It Is Not Only What You Say, It Is Also How You Say It: The Strategic Use of Campaign Sentiment","What explains the type of electoral campaign run by political parties? We provide a new perspective on campaigns that focuses on the strategic use of emotive language. We argue that the level of positive sentiment parties adopt in their campaigns depends on their incumbency status, their policy position, and objective economic conditions. We test these claims with a novel data set that captures the emotive language used in over 400 party manifestos across eight European countries. As predicted, we find that incumbent parties, particularly incumbent prime ministerial parties, use more positive sentiment than opposition parties. We find that ideologically moderate parties employ higher levels of positive sentiment than extremist parties. And we find that all parties exhibit lower levels of positive sentiment when the economy is performing poorly but that this negative effect is weaker for incumbents. Our analysis has important implications for research on campaign strategies and retrospective voting."
Positivism in Action: The Case of Louis Rougier,"In this paper, we investigate how the life and work of Louis Rougier relate to the broader political dimension of logical empiricist philosophy. We focus on three practical projects of Rougier in the 1930s and 1940s: first, his attempts to integrate French-speaking philosophers into an international network of scientific philosophers by organizing two Unity of Science conferences in Paris; second, his role in the renewal of liberalism through the organization of the Walter Lippmann Colloquium; and third, his attempts at political negotiations between Great Britain and the Vichy regime during the Second World War. These activities of Rougier in the 1930s and 1940s have so far never been discussed as part of a unified project on his part. Based on our investigations of these practical projects of Rougier, we argue that his relation to logical empiricist philosophers should primarily be understood on the level of action. His projects aimed to proliferate the concrete improvement of society and the lives of its citizens by expunging all metaphysical questions and speculations from the sphere of social discourse. Rougier conceived logical empiricist philosophers as allies to achieve such practical effects in society."
Changing Tides: Public Attitudes on Climate Migration,"Little existing work studies public perceptions of climate-induced migration. We redress this gap, drawing on diverse literatures in political science and social psychology. We argue that climate migrants occupy an intermediate position in the public view, garnering greater support than traditional economic migrants but less support than refugees. Evidence from a conjoint experiment embedded in nationally representative surveys of 2,160 respondents in the United States and Germany provide support for this claim. Importantly, this result holds for internal and international migrants. These findings suggest the importance of humanitarian considerations and empathy in shaping migration attitudes. We use a follow-up factorial experiment to explore potential policy implications of public support for climate migrants. We find no evidence that priming climate migration increases support for climate change mitigation, echoing existing work on the difficulty of mobilizing climate action and suggesting that climate migration is unlikely to spur greater support for mitigating climate change."
Waiting for the Anthropocene,"The idea that we are living in the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch defined by human activity, has gained substantial currency across the academy and with the broader public. Within the earth sciences, however, the question of the Anthropocene is hotly debated, recognized as a question that gets at both the foundations of geological science and issues of broad philosophical importance. For example, official recognition of the Anthropocene requires us to find a way to use the methods of historical science to make predictions. It also involves determining the role that political motivations should play in establishing scientific kinds. I bring the perspective of philosophy of science to bear on these questions, ultimately arguing that formal recognition of the Anthropocene should be indefinitely deferred. 1. A New Epoch 1.1. Criteria for designating a new epoch2. The Future Geologist’s Perspective 2.1. Climate change2.2. The fossil record, excluding humans2.3. The human fossil record2.4. Direct anthropogenic deposits2.5. Chemical markers2.6. Hydrology2.7. Summing up3. The Synchronic Perspective4. The Anthropocene Is Not yet Set in Stone"
"They Punched Black: Martial Arts, Black Arts, and Sports in the Urban North and West, 1968–1979","Martial artistry was an important aspect of Black Power organizing in the 1960s and 1970s. Organizations trained children and adults in martial arts in Black independent schools as well as in evening and weekend classes. By examining martial arts within the Committee for Unified Newark and the Black Panther Party in Oakland, this article focuses on how martial arts, as both athletics and arts, complicate our understanding of the strategies used to challenge political, artistic, and educational institutions. More than just recreation, I argue that martial arts training realized the Black mental, spiritual, and physical fitness goals of activists. Analyzing combat sports and unarmed self-defense expands our understanding of the relationship of Black Power to bodily movement, identity, and gender. Therefore, this article adds to Black Power and sports studies scholarship by examining organizers who believed that, in order to achieve Black freedom, one needed martial artistry."
Strangers in a Strange Land: Bruno Taut and Charlotte Perriand as Design Consultants in Japan,"Bruno Taut, the German architect and planner, and Charlotte Perriand, the French designer and architect, left their respective countries abruptly during the Nazi regime to work as design consultants for the Japanese export industry. Japan might seem an odd choice under the political circumstances, but for both it was a pragmatic solution to problems at home. They were hired by national design centers that aimed to promote Japanese folkloristic traditions with an inflection of modernism in order to make their products attractive to the Western market. As newcomers there, Taut and Perriand were caught in the conflict between local culture and international modernization."
Closing the Gap: Information and Mass Support in a Dominant Party Regime,"What role does information play in shaping mass support in dominant party settings? We conduct a field experiment during the 2016 Ugandan parliamentary elections that provides voters with information about candidates from all competing political parties. Specifically, we produce and screen videorecorded candidate interviews in randomly selected villages just before the election. Voters have lower baseline knowledge about opposition candidates compared to ruling party candidates. We find that the video screening reduced this knowledge gap and caused voters to update more positively about the opposition. Further, those who watched the videos were less likely to vote for ruling party candidates, and those initially leaning toward ruling party candidates were more likely to vote for the opposition. These findings suggest that information asymmetries play a role in sustaining mass support for ruling parties in dominant party settings and that reducing them may strengthen electoral competition."
Confirmation Dynamics: Differential Vetting in the Appointment of US Federal Agency Leaders,"Confirmation delay is decomposed to better understand both when and why the Senate augments its efforts to vet presidential nominees. Distinctions among expedited, normal, and protracted confirmation processes are analyzed, as well as those between the work of Senate standing committees and chamber floor. A theory of ex ante moral hazard reduction is proposed that predicts as the confirmation process becomes increasingly protracted in response to rising potential agency costs, the Senate will be increasingly swifter to confirm tier 1 top executive leaders to US federal agency leadership positions than tier 2 subordinate leadership nominees. The statistical evidence is consistent with this theory of differential vetting between nominee tiers for both Senate party polarization and the nominee’s loyalty to the appointing president, as well as for agency decision-making independence restricted to protracted confirmation processes. Yet, such differential vetting is not empirically observed in response to interbranch policy conflict."
Endogenous Policy Making,"Ryan Carlin and Timothy Hellwig challenge our claim that voters misattribute responsibility for economic performance in low-savings commodity-exporting (LSCE) countries of Latin America. They argue that we overlook incumbents’ capacity to choose “policy regimes” that signal to voters their level of control the economy. They also claim that LSCE membership should be allowed to vary over time and that, even then, the concept is not useful to distinguish the impact of exogenous conditions on political outcomes. This article demonstrates that several implications of Carlin and Hellwig’s alternative theory are not supported by the evidence, that their measure of policy regimes is endogenous to international conditions, and that even considering variation over time, Latin American countries remain clustered into the two original categories we proposed. We finish by showing that exogenous conditions affect presidential popularity in other LSCE countries and that the deviating case of Chile only reinforces our theory."
The End of Americanization? or Reinventing a Research Field for Historians of Europe,"The Americanization of Europe has been an elusive and controversial topic for historians because it poses questions of definition, causation, development, and significance. This essay addresses these issues, reviews the historiographical record, reassesses the current paradigm, and presents an agenda for future research. A revitalized paradigm theorizes Americanization as a disruptive force on European society and culture rather than a process of benign appropriation or trivial imitation. It incorporates American corporate and political power limiting local agency, treats transatlantic exchange at multiple levels while retaining the filter of the national, and maintains that the process, rather than coming to an end, has become the new norm. I also argue that Americanization functioned as a stimulus and foil for self-assessment that illuminates basic concerns of Europeans. Most important, the phenomenon of Americanization represents the American phase of European globalization, identifying America’s contribution to the interconnection and homogenization of the transatlantic community but also exposing resistance to transnationalism. Anti-Americanism, the twentieth-century opposition to Americanization, anticipated current challenges to globalization. My aim is to rescue this topic from critics who have disparaged it and to (re)establish it as a viable field of historical research. For Europeans, the twentieth century was the American century."
Taking the Long Route: Ethnographic Metacommentary as Method in the Anthropological Film Practice,"This article introduces “ethnographic metacommentary,” an experiential, processual, and protracted approach to ethnography. My proposed method goes beyond stating complexity as the defining characteristic of an anthropological project, visual or otherwise. To demonstrate the method, I write an ethnographic metacommentary of my 3-minute film Performing Naturalness (2008), which is about the surveillance of foreigners in Tokyo. A number of contexts on the film are explored—the political situation from which it arose, the background of the experiment chosen for the project, and genealogies of art practice. The method includes the process of “furtherings”—self-reflexive explorations that unpack aspects of the project that often retreat from anthropological ethnography. Overall, in the process of writing this ethnographic metacommentary, this article explores the nuanced experiences of Filipinos in transnational migration, contributes to the conversation on contemporary Philippine conceptual art and its relationship with anthropology and film/art practice, and fleshes out difficulties of representation in collaborative projects due to differences in intentions and locatedness. I show how ethnographic metacommentary is a productive thought process that fleshes out ruptures in the filmmaking process that are often concealed from the audience, and even from the filmmakers."
"Disability, Anonymous Love, and Interworldly Socials in Urban India","This essay considers disability studies scholars’ investment in “the social” as a site of rehabilitation, recuperation, and cure in order to argue that in urban India, the case is otherwise: the public often engages with disability through “anonymous love,” which produces opportunities for the concretization of disability as a category, for disabled people to exist socially, and for validation of an existing social. I argue, however, that this conceptualization and enactment of the social is empirically unfulfilling and analytically limiting. I then turn to ethnographic research conducted in deaf churches in order to consider what other forms of engagement might emerge when we include the interworldly—engagements with God, the Divine, or the Spirit—in our analysis of disability worlds. This essay argues that including the interworldly offers an alternative animation of the social as a concept. Overall, attending to the interworldly leads to the creation of nonliberal and nonsecular alterworlds where alternative renderings of the social that are not premised on the politics of biosocial recognition are made possible."
Grande Hotel Beira: Mozambique’s White Elephant,"Few buildings represent contemporary Mozambican politics more than the Grande Hotel in Mozambique’s second-biggest city, Beira. Conceived in a Portuguese colonial dream, the Grande Hotel once breathed luxury. But megalomania and mismanagement turned it all into a fever dream. When the colonizers left, more rowdy roads followed for the building and its new inhabitants. The once five-star hotel became headquarters for the former guerrillas during the country’s civil war, a prison for their political prisoners, and an improvised refugee camp. The scars of the past are still everywhere to be seen. The whato muno (from here), as the inhabitants are called, remain hopeful nevertheless. Even Cyclone Idai, in 2019, could not destroy their home."
Introduction: Reusing Research Film and the Institute for Scientific Film,"This introduction outlines the threefold contribution that this Focus section on research film offers. First, it introduces the vast collection of films from the former Institute for Scientific Film (Institut für den Wissenschaftlichen Film [IWF]), arguably the most ambitious endeavor ever undertaken to manage the distribution, production, and archiving of research films. At the same time, the institute’s questionable roots in the National Socialist education system and in war research are addressed. Second, the introduction points out that the Focus section enters largely uncharted terrain in the history of research films. Third, it argues that a focus on the multiple reuses of research films, as this section attempts, not only suits the medium specificity of film but helps us to map the aesthetic, intermedial, and cultural-political practices of disseminating knowledge. In this vein, the organizers asked established scholars working on film and science to share with us a short story of a reused research film. Scott Curtis, Vinzenz Hediger, Anja Laukötter, and Hanna Rose Shell responded. Their contributions can be found in the supplementary materials to the online edition."
Instrumental Authority and Its Challenges: The Case of the Laws of War,"Law and Morality at War offers a broadly instrumentalist defense of the authority of the laws of war: these laws serve combatants by helping them come closer to doing what they have independent moral reason to do. We argue that this form of justification (invoked by many legal and political theorists) sets too low a bar. An authority’s directives are not binding, on instrumental grounds, if the subject could, within certain limits, adopt an alternative, and superior, means of conforming to morality’s demands. It emerges that Haque’s argument fails to vindicate the law’s authority over all (or even most) combatants."
Strategic Delay and the Use of Incompatibility Rulings at the German Constitutional Court,"Constitutional review has become a hallmark of modern liberal democracy. The efficacy of this review, however, is far from guaranteed. In this article, I argue that courts enhance judicial authority by using discretion over the temporal effect of decisions invalidating legislation. Building on the comparative judicial politics literature on the separation of powers and strategic judicial behavior, I develop a theoretical account of how courts strategically delay the implementation of their decisions through the declaration of a statute’s incompatibility with the constitution. The accompanying theoretical model’s main prediction is that courts use this tactic when the incumbent government is electorally weak, as delaying compliance raises the probability of a new government taking office and subsequently implementing the decision. An empirical analysis of incompatibility rulings by the German Federal Constitutional Court supports the model’s predictions."
Growing Up in Epic: Transformations of the Doloneia,"Iterations of the epic topos of the night raid (Doloneia) deriving from book 10 of the Iliad intersect with the motif of puberty in significant ways. For an Elizabethan author interested in the formation of sexual identity, this intersection triggers a range of literary transformations and modes of literary self-consciousness that can inform any given reference to sexual awakening. Erotic desire as a theme is not an intrinsic aspect of the epic topos but a variation introduced to it by Virgil in order to differentiate the emotional bonds of personal loyalty from the claims of duty the individual owes a collective entity. Subsequent epic poets Ariosto, Tasso, and Spenser shape a tradition as each reworks elements of the Virgilian paradigm to explore the formation of gender and social identity in relation to structures of political power and cultural heritage."
Traditional Leaders and the 2014–2015 Ebola Epidemic,"We assess the role of traditional authorities during an acute health crisis, the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. We exploit plausible exogenous variation in the political competition for local chieftaincy positions and find evidence that traditional leaders helped shape the course of the epidemic. Locations with more “powerful” chiefs experienced substantially fewer recorded Ebola cases. We argue that this result is consistent with a view of traditional authorities as “stationary bandits,” in which leaders are locally embedded and thus benefited directly from controlling the spread of the disease. Subsequently, control measures were most effectively implemented by more powerful chiefs."
"Subversive, Mother, Killjoy: Sexism against Dilma Rousseff and the Social Imaginary of Brazil’s Rightward Turn","From resistance fighter against Brazil’s military dictatorship to its first female president, Dilma Rousseff’s biography follows the historic arc of democratization in Brazil. Her 2016 impeachment was also the culminating event of numerous crises that polarized Brazilian society. To supporters, Rousseff’s removal without evidence constitutes an abrogation of democracy. To critics, Rousseff had to answer for an economic recession and widespread corruption (though she was not implicated in any investigation). This article examines the social imaginaries of the rightward turn that made Rousseff’s removal possible. Moving across diverse sets of public culture—street protests, journalistic accounts, political observations, and Rousseff’s speeches—the article uses sexism against Rousseff as an analytic to deconstruct the cultural narratives of Brazil’s rightward turn. A first section considers conservative efforts to paint Rousseff as a political subversive. These accusations drew on long-standing, right-wing Brazilian tropes around people who don’t “act right” in the moral, sexual, and ideological fields. A second section reads the maternal metaphors of Rousseff’s governance strategies against conflicting political renderings of the family—pitting left-wing versions of family rooted in economic development against Evangelical Christian accounts of the family as a gender-normative unit. A third section argues that Rousseff’s response to the charges against her turned her (and those who argued her case) into what Sara Ahmed calls “feminist killjoys.” Ultimately, the question of sexism in Rousseff’s impeachment shows how deep-seated cultural conservatisms can be activated in a new era of democratic uncertainty."
Sensitive Places?: How Gender Unmasks the Myth of Originalism in District of Columbia v. Heller,"This case study of the Second Amendment precedent, District of Columbia v. Heller, synthesizes insights from political theory, feminist legal theory, critical race theory, and American legal history to illustrate how Heller endorses a patriarchal theory of armed self-defense. The Court relies on the right of the “head of household” to protect the home against invaders but ignores the crucial context of common-law coverture, which instantiates husbands as rulers of married women. Originalism promises that courts can execute a “sacred” text, but Heller’s selective and skewed originalism creates a right of armed self-defense that threatens women’s ability to defend themselves against those who most frequently endanger them: known assailants in the home. Originalism does not provide neutrality; it conceals interpretation. Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism requires us to reify the historical context, and thus the legal inferiority of women and Black Americans at the time of the framing, ratification, and reconstruction of the Constitution. This case study casts doubt on both the practice of the methodology and the principle upon which originalism rests."
Locke and Tocqueville on Religious Foundationalism,"In this article, I offer a fresh perspective on John Locke’s and Alexis de Tocqueville’s religious statesmanship that sheds light on the moral and political problems facing America today. Both thinkers maintain that a firmly held set of religious beliefs must ground the popular mores, or character traits, that support liberty. According to most scholars, Locke considers popular enlightenment the best means for promoting these beliefs. I argue, however, that Locke mistrusts intellectual freedom and seeks to use authority to promote the core doctrines of reasonable Christianity, which is his preferred faith. I also compare Locke’s version of religious foundationalism with Tocqueville’s more well-known case for this concept and show how Tocqueville modifies reasonable Christianity to strengthen it against democratic skepticism. I conclude by briefly reflecting on the weakening of America’s religious foundations today and on what this portends for the future."
Open-Economy Public Finance,"Many important questions in the field of public finance can be viewed as problems involving public policies in open economies. This paper draws together, from that perspective, a wide range of topics in public economics, emphasizing the implications of resource mobility for our understanding of the efficiency and distributional impacts of public policies. These topics are relevant for the purposes of policy evaluation, political economy, and the broadest questions of governance and of public sector organization at all levels of government, from the purely local to the global."
"Capital, “Moralization,” and Race in the French Imperial Plantation Zone, 1830–1848","When France’s liberal July Monarchy took power in 1830, there were immediate calls to abolish slavery. In the ensuing debate, commentators proceeded from the assumption that the labor of the same colonial population—whether enslaved or free—should remain integrated within a substantially continuous process of commodity production. Not only slaveholders but also abolitionists of many stripes envisioned the destiny of colonial society as the commodity-producing plantation—which they intended to uplift rather than end. Arguments of political opponents converged, because they were constructed in terms of racial categories whose inner structure articulated to capital, displacing its components across human bodies. Post-abolition, these racially displaced elements of capital were to be reintegrated by a quasi-educational process. This debate—engaging figures as disparate as liberal Alexis de Tocqueville, radical republican Victor Schœlcher, and slaveholding planters—specified preconditions for capitalism that surprisingly prefigured the social logic later developed systematically by Karl Marx."
How Divisive Primaries Hurt Parties: Evidence from Near-Runoffs in US Legislatures,"In many democracies, parties use primary elections to nominate candidates. Primaries may help select quality candidates, but they can expose flaws and offend losing candidates’ supporters. Do divisive primaries help or harm parties in the general election? Existing research is mixed, likely because of issues of selection and omitted variables. We address these issues by studying southern US states with runoff primaries—second-round elections that, when triggered, create more divisive primaries. Using a regression discontinuity design, we estimate that a runoff decreases the party’s general-election vote share in the House and Senate by approximately 6 percentage points and decreases the party’s win probability by approximately 21 percentage points, on average. Opposing results in southern state legislatures suggest that divisive primaries are damaging when salience is high but beneficial when it is low, a pattern we speculate is driven by the competing effects of information in high- versus low-salience primaries."
How a Retreat from Global Economic Governance May Empower Business Interests,"After decades of broad, bipartisan support for global economic integration, US politics has been shaken by a backlash against global economic governance. The promise of internationally derived gains no longer suffices to smooth over domestic distributional consequences. The Trump administration has turned inward, shunning multilateral governance and raising the following question: If the US and other protectionist governments step back from global economic governance, what will step forward? We contend that weakened global governance is unlikely to cause economic integration itself to unravel. Powerful business interests that benefit from the global economy can use private governance to set their own regulatory agendas using their market power. By stepping away from global governance, states weaken their own bargaining power vis-à-vis powerful domestic groups and curtail the influence of civil society groups. Paradoxically, the Trump administration’s step back from global governance would leave power in the hands of firms that predominantly benefit from the status quo."
Education Activism in the Syrian Civil War: Resisting by Persisting,"This article analyzes education activists’ resilience in emergencies, building on life story interviews with Syrians who engaged in civil society initiatives for schooling in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising. It investigates the meaning that education acquires under extreme adversity and how it inspires individuals to act. Finding that these activists think of education as a means to resist authoritarianism and transform society, the article brings the change agendas of local education actors to the fore. It concludes that resilience can be the extension of political purpose. The article conceptualizes education as a vehicle of resistance, foregrounding how temporal projections enable individuals to maintain belief in their capability to enact changes. The activists make connections between their own experiences in school, thoughts about the future, and the reasons they mobilize for education. Working with time is a potent enabler when, objectively, the situation is deteriorating."
The Migration of a Form: An Ancient Concept of Justice Resurfaces in the Modern Artwork,"The history of Iraq in the twentieth century, and perhaps the Middle East more broadly, is punctuated by an intellectual shift that has, for the most part, escaped the attention of scholars. It might be characterized as a shift from a problem of representation introduced by the rise of left-wing politics, to a problem of experience created by its failure. This shift registers in the work of writers and artists, where the depiction of the social world gave way to an exploration of states of being. The paradigm for that turn inward in modern art was set by the artist Kadhim Haidar, in a series of paintings exhibited at the National Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad, in 1965, under the title The Epic of the Martyr [Malḥamat al-shahīd]. The paintings reconstructed imagery from the mourning processions that annually commemorate the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, al-Husayn. This paper argues that the ritual imagery contains a grammar of experience, forged in the early history of Islam, that linked justice to a state of being, and that the transposition of the imagery into painting activated that grammar in the artwork."
Younger Federal District Court Judges Favor Presidential Power,"From 1960 to 2015, opinions of US federal district court judges (trial judges) in cases involving challenges to executive branch authority show that these judges favor executive authority less as they age. We suggest that district judges know that elevation to the federal circuit court of appeals becomes increasingly improbable, and hence have less reason to cooperate with the executive, with advancing age. Political variables, seniority of judges, and other variables introduced as extra regressors do not reverse this main result, nor does it appear to be the product of cohort effects or selection off the district court. When there are contemporaneous vacancies on their circuit courts, district judges in the 11 state circuits (but not the District of Columbia Circuit) are also more likely to favor the executive."
Introduction: Sign and Script in South Asia,"This essay introduces a collection of six articles that analyze the political economy of language and script in relation to the emergence and contestation of identities and publics in contemporary India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and South Asian diasporas. Social media and the virtual forums that they enable have inspired new representational practices and discursive possibilities that are in dialogue with older ways of ordering difference. Rather than making a hard-and-fast distinction between new and old media, this issue draws on the rich visual tapestries of South Asia to examine implicit and explicit debates over codes, scripts, and sign language systems in relation to different forms of print and digital media, from street signs to social media posts. We demonstrate the centrality of visual semiotic systems in processes of political, economic, and sociocultural change in contemporary South Asia."
"The Elevationists: Gerrit Smith, Black Agrarianism, and Land Reform in 1840s New York","AbstractThis article tells the story of the attempt by Gerrit Smith to establish a farming settlement for free African Americans in the Adirondack Mountains of New York from 1846 to 1850. Smith was a white abolitionist and a founding member of the Liberty Party. Over the course of the 1840s, he became increasingly committed to the land reform movement, coming to believe that the small family farm was the key to lasting environmental health and economic prosperity. Smith’s settlement scheme represents an attempt to merge the racial politics of abolitionism with the environmental ideology of Free Soil agrarianism. His plan attracted the attention of some of the period’s most prominent black abolitionists, including James McCune Smith, Henry Highland Garnet, and Frederick Douglass, who came to see farm life as a means to restore African Americans’ health after the damage wrought by slavery and racism. This article traces the discourse of agrarianism that took shape around Smith’s settlement plan, which saw farm life as being capable of elevating both the farmer and the land itself."
"Strategic Power Sharing: Commitment, Capability, and Authoritarian Survival","All dictators confront threats to their survival in office. One strategy is to share power with challengers. Using a formal model, I provide new insights into the conditions under which dictators share power and how this choice affects survival. Sharing power bolsters the coercive capability of the challenger, which creates dual consequences. (1) Commitment effect: the challenger mobilizes more frequently, which enables the dictator to credibly commit to more future concessions. (2) Threat-enhancing effect: the challenger wins a conflict with higher probability, which makes the challenger harder to buy off. The ruler faces two distinct motives to marginalize the challenger. First, a weak challenger does not fight despite mobilizing infrequently, which encourages opportunistic exclusion. Second, the dictator maximizes long-term expected consumption rather than survival per se, which can encourage greedy exclusion. The ruler strategically shares power only if doing so switches equilibrium bargaining from conflictual to peaceful without creating a high opportunity cost from lost rents."
"Properties of (Dis)Possession: Therapeutic Plants, Intellectual Property, and Questions of Justice in Tanzania","Late colonial efforts to articulate witchcraft and herbalism intervened in the precolonial categories of practice through which East Africans differentiated healing (uganga) and harming (uchawi). Taking these interventions as critical points in the genealogy of traditional medicine in Tanzania enables an account of how and why plants have become central to contemporary debates over indigenous knowledge. Developing, promoting, and protecting traditional medicine today requires articulating the properties of plants elucidated by science with the properties of ownership prescribed by modern law. This essay traces the practices of knowing and unknowing that forged traditional medicine in Tanzania and their role in constituting the terms, objects, and institutions through which struggles for justice have been imagined. I argue that the dynamism of traditional medicine as a modern category of knowledge and practice lay in its ability to solve (first colonial and then postcolonial) problems of knowledge and politics simultaneously. Twenty-first-century Tanzanian scientists, healers, herbal producers, policy makers, and patients grapple with these colonial legacies. Yet, traditional medicine has never fully captured the wide range of practices that strive to catalyze growth, fullness, maturation, extension, strength, and fertility. Healing remains unruly, and the friction this creates holds open the possibility of generating alternative forms of the therapeutic value of plants and rendering visible the ongoing forms of (dis)possession that shape notions of justice in late liberalism."
Mafiacraft: How to do things with silence,"How to construct an ethnography about such a phenomenon as “the mafia,” shrouded in silence? What methods might anthropologists use to investigate silence and understand the denied, the unspeakable, the implicit, and the unspoken? The ethnographer can begin by indexing the conjectures and speculations surrounding this mysterious entity, describing the social, judicial, or graphic acts made in the attempt to break up the silence in and around this secret phenomenon, and exposing the manifold issues at stake regarding its indeterminacy: impunity, invisibility, unrepresentability. The methodological assumption is that “the mafia” is not a social fact fixed once and for all, available for being studied or “exposed,” but a cognitive event shaped by silence. In the process of producing an ethnography of what has been said or written on this secret and uncertain phenomenon, one comes to realize the imaginative power of silence, giving consistency to special kinds of social facts which draw substance from their indeterminacy. Hence, the need to coin a neologism, mafiacraft, which I discuss as an inverted paradigm of witchcraft: while the latter emphasizes the power of words, the former highlights the strength of silence: how does it resist, fight, or capitulate to the strength of words or to the force of law?"
Melvin Edwards Decides,"In 1970 Melvin Edwards crisscrossed a gallery in the Whitney Museum of American Art with barbed wire. His work was in reaction to developments in American art, especially Minimalism, but in material that evoked violent racism, raising significant and still potent questions about how abstract art can meaningfully address the politics of race. Recently, Edwards’s long-neglected work has been featured in several major books and high-profile exhibitions. This scholarship, however, has mostly focused on his response to debates on Black Art in the civil rights era, separating his work from the dominant approaches to modern sculpture that Edwards both referenced and reconfigured. Rather than protest the museum from without, he criticized it from within, addressing the art world’s exclusion of African American artists by installing barbed wire and directing the Minimalist emphasis on literal space toward the more specific problem of Black art in the white cube."
Rome’s Best Man: The Vir Optimus Debate of 204 BCE and the Study of Roman Masculinity,"This article scrutinizes the Senate’s choice of the young P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica as vir optimus (“best man”) in Rome in 204 BCE, and the ancient historiographic tradition regarding his qualifications. While a certain explanation about Nasica’s credentials is not possible, later authors attributed a range of moral qualities to him, especially pietas, manifested as youthful patriotic duty. I read this historiographic tradition as an exercise by ancient authors in defining ideals of masculinity. Then, I situate these findings within current scholarship on Roman masculinity that typically emphasizes violence and sexual penetration. The tradition about Nasica’s selection suggests a more nuanced ancient understanding of elite manliness that accounts for the necessity for elite men to couch aggressive imperatives within the bounds of republican consensus and cooperative politics."
Hindu nationalism’s crisis machine,"This essay looks at Hindu nationalism’s investment in a crisis machine linked closely to digital media networks in India. Media infrastructures have provided right-wing populism with new techniques for performative action and network-driven collective expansion. A crisis ontology inherent in digital media has helped Hindu nationalism to optimize techniques of mobilization across time and space. While ambulatory, media-enabled populations are subject to periodic political stimuli, online collective movements are driven by a cluster of Hindu nationalist microcelebrities and regional performers. Hindu nationalist supporters periodically initiate multiple event chains to attract users across digital platforms. What we see is the “eventalization” of time where online populations are drawn into periodic bursts of sustained intensity. In this process, graphic video documents once seen as peripheral to public culture are now periodically occupying center stage in the current political spectacle. Within the space of a few years, Hindu nationalism’s crisis machine has substantially shifted the public culture of the republic."
Soviet and Russian Masculinities: Rethinking Soviet Fatherhood after Stalin and Renewing Virility in the Russian Nation under Putin,"Vladimir Putin’s macho image and his deployment of a masculinized Russian nationalism have fascinated Russians and non-Russians alike, generating considerable public and scholarly analysis. This article argues that the appeal of Putin as a powerful and hypermasculine leader over the last twenty years is best understood not just in the larger geopolitical context of Russia’s national and economic decline in the 1990s but also in terms of Soviet and post-Soviet discourses of failed manhood. In particular, this work focuses on the widespread critique of men as fathers in the 1950s and 1960s and the accompanying campaign to create a new model of Soviet fatherhood, aiming to make men into “family men” and better fathers. The construction of the new ideal father—actively engaged in household tasks and child-rearing—challenged the Soviet gender order and contributed to the development of a domestic and family-oriented model of Communist manhood. Although it is primarily an investigation of the problematization of Soviet fathers and the reconfiguration of Soviet fatherhood in the 1950s and 1960s, this article also suggests that perceptions of failed fatherhood and Communist manhood in the post-Stalin and late Soviet eras, combined with post-Soviet anxieties about masculinity in the new political and economic order of Russia in the 1990s, provide a window into the appeal not only of Putin and his strongman persona but also of the broader narratives of masculinized nationalism in contemporary Russia."
Agricultural Comparative Advantage and Legislators’ Support for Trade Agreements,Does comparative advantage explain legislators’ support for trade liberalization? We use data on potential crop yields as determined by weather and soil characteristics to derive a new plausibly exogenous measure of comparative advantage in agriculture for each district in the United States. Evidence shows that comparative advantage in agriculture predicts how legislators vote on the ratification of preferential trade agreements in Congress. We show that legislators in districts with high agricultural comparative advantage are more likely to mention that trade agreements are good for agriculture in House floor debates preceding roll call votes on their ratifications. Individuals living in the same districts are also more likely to support free trade. Our analysis and results contribute to the literature on the political economy of trade and its distributional consequences and to our understanding of the economic determinants of legislators’ voting decisions.
Does International Terrorism Affect Public Attitudes toward Refugees? Evidence from a Large-Scale Natural Experiment,"Does international terrorism affect attitudes toward refugees? Does terrorism mobilize the public to pressure legislators to restrict refugee policy? Are these effects long- or short-lived? To answer these questions, this article presents results from a large-scale natural experiment to investigate the effects of the 2015 Islamic State terrorist attacks in Paris on attitudes toward Syrian refugees in a country that is a major recipient of refugees (Canada). The results demonstrate that the attacks increased (1) anxiety over refugee resettlement, (2) perceptions of refugees as a security and cultural threat, and (3) opposition to resettlement. Furthermore, the attacks increased mobilization among resettlement’s opponents. Using a large-scale survey (n=18,634) fielded daily across a three-week period, however, we show that these effects were decidedly short-lived. The findings are highly relevant to our understanding of public reactions to major terrorist attacks and the responses of political entrepreneurs in their aftermath."
Scenes from the Fringe: Gendered Violence and the Geographies of Indigenous Feminism,"The 2002 arrest of Robert Pickton, the most notorious serial murderer in Canadian history, prompted an outpouring of responses from Indigenous women artists, writers, and filmmakers. Through their cultural work, these artists demanded attention to the disproportionately high number of Aboriginal women among Pickton’s victims, the reasons for Indigenous women’s heightened vulnerability to sexual violence, and the ways that gendered violence is bound up with the ongoing colonization of Native communities. In these ways, they endeavored to cultivate public understandings of the racial dimensions of the murders, understandings that could usefully inform contemporary conversations surrounding sexual violence such as those in the #MeToo movement, as they also engaged in an Indigenous feminist practice that centers on culture. But as Native women visual artists endeavored to turn images of the Indigenous woman’s body into figures of social protest, they confronted the enduring weight of colonial representations that threaten to mute subversive political meanings. This essay examines the political limits and possibilities of the figure of the Indigenous woman’s body in three visual cultural texts created in response to the Pickton murders: Rebecca Belmore’s billboard photograph Fringe (2007) and street performance Vigil (2002), and Christine Welsh’s documentary film Finding Dawn (2006). In particular, it analyzes how these artists reckon with histories of visual representation, which have debased Indigenous people, while also rendering women mute and reducing them to the flesh, and how they instead endeavor to use visual technologies to support Indigenous political and territorial claims, including those related to gender justice."
Cultures of Militarism: An Introduction to Supplement 19,"This volume contributes to a new anthropology of militarism that has crystallized since the end of the cold war. Unlike scholars in mainstream security studies and political science, anthropologists treat militarism as a process rather than a reified, measurable quantum acting as an independent variable. Anthropological analysis of militarism focuses on the social construction of security threats; the decentering of the state’s monopoly over legitimate violence in an era where guerillas, paramilitaries, and military contractors hold unprecedented sway; the increasing hybridization of war and peace in the context of a permanent war economy; the capillary colonization of social and imaginative life by military processes thanks to militarized media institutions; and the suffering, both bodily and psychological, of those who are killed, injured, bereaved, or dislocated by military processes. In the context of a global militarized capitalist system, this suffering is transmuted into profit in various centers of accumulation. Whereas folk ideology may portray individual military initiatives as defensive moves against aggression, this analysis reframes militarism as an integrated global system with its own escalatory logic that feeds off actors’ inability to recognize the ways in which each militarized action reinforces the growth of militarism as a transnational exterminist structure."
The Wild West of Sentencing Reform: Lessons from California,"As the United States became notorious for mass incarceration, California received outsized attention. Not so much for the sheer volume of California imprisonment but because of its chaotic operation. Populist political mood swings led to Eighth Amendment violations that caused a federal court to declare the whole system unconstitutional, a decision ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011). The state responded with innovations commonly referred to as realignment, which include a dramatic devolution of incarcerative power from state to county, among other major changes. Disaster has been avoided, thanks to clever low-level and low-visibility workings of legal and political mechanisms to control populist democracy. But the DNA of California’s mode of governing cautions that nothing remains stable without foundational reform."
Constitutional Humility: The Contested Meaning of a Judicial Virtue,"References to the “humility” and “hubris” of judges are common in American political and constitutional discourse, but neither public nor scholarly commentators have developed an adequate theoretical framework for what humility means in the context of constitutional jurisprudence. In this article, we first draw out the common themes and tensions among conceptions of judicial humility by providing an extensive review of scholarly treatments of humility as a judicial virtue. Second, we develop a theoretical account of constitutional humility that delineates two interrelated dimensions: “epistemological humility,” an inward-looking, self-referential dimension; and “institutional humility,” an outward-looking, other-directed dimension. We argue that these dimensions work together to provide a complete account of constitutional humility. Finally, we conclude by highlighting how this conception of constitutional humility can improve our judicial practice and public discourse."
"Missing Shakespeare, 1642–1660","This essay explains the mysterious decline in the publication of Shakespeare’s plays during the English Civil Wars and Interregnum, relative both to his dramatic contemporaries and to his own earlier and later records. Unpopularity is an inadequate explanation for his decline. Rather, a combination of the quotidian trials of the book trade—legal battles, political turmoil and concomitant publication trends, as well as the deaths of stationers likely to reprint Shakespeare—as well as dramatic stationers’ increased attention to first editions (which Shakespeare, as the most printed dramatist of the preceding five decades, was excluded from) all contributed to Shakespeare’s relative absence in print between 1642 and 1660. The essay also explains the timing and appearance of the three Shakespeare quartos published in the 1650s: The Merchant of Venice (1652), Othello (1655), and King Lear (1655).The essay concludes with an examination of Shakespearean misattributions in book list catalogues, arguing that they reveal the types of plays associated with Shakespeare in the Interregnum. Despite little new print publication, Shakespeare was a well-known dramatist in this period, but for which plays was not always clear. [H.C.]"
Disproportional Threat: Redistricting as an Alternative to Proportional Representation,"Analyzing the voting behavior of Swiss members of parliament (MP) using newly collected individual, district, and cantonal level data, we show that both electoral disproportionalities and the insurgent parties’ electoral potential are important determinants of MP voting behavior on the adoption of proportional representation (PR). However, in contrast to the prominent electoral threat thesis, the insurgent party’s high electoral potential decreases the probability that MPs of established parties support PR. The reason for this relationship is partisan redistricting, whose relevance has so far been largely ignored in the literature. We demonstrate that adapting electoral district boundaries for political reasons, if possible in a given institutional context, can be a powerful alternative to the adoption of PR, because it allows established parties to retain parliamentary majorities even as an insurgent party’s electoral potential increases."
"Asylum Seekers, Antiforeigner Violence, and Coming to Terms with the Past after German Reunification","In the early 1990s, more asylum seekers entered the Federal Republic of Germany than at any previous time in its history. This unleashed the greatest wave of antiforeigner violence in Germany since the end of World War II. In the midst of this crisis, over a thousand Germans wrote to President Richard von Weizsäcker to share their views on the asylum debate and antiforeigner violence. Many letter writers turned to the experience and memory of the Third Reich and the immediate postwar years in order to explain their attitudes toward asylum seekers and antiforeigner violence. While some letter writers, outraged at the violence, proclaimed “never again,” more called upon memories of the Nazi era and the immediate postwar years to argue that Germany had no responsibility to care for asylum seekers. The analysis of these letters sheds new light on German attitudes toward asylum seekers as well as German memory of World War II. The article argues that while Germany’s Holocaust-centered memory culture gained ground during the 1990s, memories of World War II that emphasized German victimization followed by heroic renewal proved to be both durable and widespread. Memories of the Nazi era and the war years informed Germans’ attitudes on one of the most burning political issues facing the young Berlin Republic: what should be done about the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers? This article also seeks to complicate our understanding of the relationship between Holocaust memory and racism."
A Troubled Body of Knowledge: The Durability of Racial Science in Human Anatomy Research in South Africa,"This article examines the durability of racial science in the field of anatomy at one of South Africa’s oldest universities and its resonance with race essentialist research in other national and transnational contexts. We present a critical assessment of more than 70 published and unpublished papers in anatomy through the lens of the politics of knowledge; in this perspective, scientific knowledge is viewed as socially constructed, value-laden, and acting in the service of power. The study finds that racial science thinking in medical science research persists after apartheid, that “race” is a poor proxy for explaining complex patterns of disease, and that by medicalizing health maladies scientists fail to account for their links to racialized inequalities in the broader society. Research on the workings of racial science in the health sciences suggests promising new lines of inquiry into the study of “racial projects” in comparative and international education."
How Mayors Hurt Their Presidential Ticket: Party Brands and Incumbency Spillovers in Brazil,"Much of the literature in distributive politics suggests that parties are advantaged nationally when they control office at the local level. But is this invariably true? Whatever advantage control over the local patronage machinery may offer, local governments might under some conditions tarnish their parties’ labels and thus hurt up-ticket candidates. Using a regression discontinuity design in mayoral races in Brazil, exogenous variation in fiscal resources, and a survey experiment, my analysis demonstrates the critical role that party labels play in linking national and local elections. I show that the presidential tickets of parties with strong brands suffer an electoral penalty in municipalities governed by copartisans, especially when voters are dissatisfied with the local government. Loosely organized parties with weak party labels do not suffer a similar disadvantage. Hence, this study shows that for programmatic parties with strong party brands, mayors can sometimes be a burden rather than an asset."
"Forgetting the Great War? The Langemarck Myth between Cultural Oblivion and Critical Memory in (West) Germany, 1945–2014","This article explores the way in which the First World War continued to speak to (West) German culture in the wake of the Second World War. It takes issue with the commonly held view that the Great War is a “long forgotten war” eclipsed by an even greater conflict. The notion of the “forgotten war” is best understood as a cultural representation in its own right, often used for political ends. Building on recent theoretical literature on cultural oblivion, this article charts the trajectory of remembrance and “forgetting” from the end of the Second World War to the centenary of the First World War. Focusing on the once powerful war myth of Langemarck, it examines the agency of war veterans, the war graves association, local administrators, public intellectuals, and grassroots activists to show that important memory traces of the Great War remained after 1945. Increasingly, though, Germans tended to approach war in a different register, one that was cerebral rather than emotional. The demise of the generation of veterans of the Great War triggered not an era of oblivion, but instead the most intense period of (critical) engagement with the First World War. This meant that the mode and mood of war commemoration changed permanently during the 1980s. A new, highly localized memory of the First World War became divorced from the traditional topography of remembrance that had centered on the Western Front. Now the emphasis was placed on confronting the past and on the lessons to be learned from it."
The Font of the Interdict: Reconsidering the Function of Ornament on the Baptismal Font of San Giovanni in Pisa,"In 1246, a lavishly ornamented baptismal font was completed in Pisa, shortly after a papal interdict had been laid upon the city. What did it mean to the Pisans to erect such a grandiose religious monument precisely at this moment? And how is this reflected in the font’s decorative scheme? This article argues that not only the figurative elements in the font’s overall design, but most decidedly also its ornament, contribute to shaping a specific image of Pisan identity that closely responds to the political needs of the time."
Remembering the Destruction(s) of the Temple at the Museum of the Bible,"This essay explores how objects related to the Jerusalem temple have been employed in theological and political discourse in the modern era. In particular, it examines how the Museum of the Bible (Washington, DC) uses a fragment of the retaining wall of Jerusalem’s Temple Mount to help create a “pilgrimage” experience for visitors. The author demonstrates how the museum’s depictions of Jewish society are structured around and in service to New Testament narratives. He also explores how the museum depicts the Bible as a remnant of the Second Temple that has survived the destruction and the trials of time to reach us today."
Disobedient Video in France in the 1970s: Video Production by Women’s Collectives,"In light of recent archival efforts, Stéphanie Jeanjean considers the legacy of the feminist video collectives that formed in France in the 1970s, tracing their radical approach to class and gender politics."
Between speaking and enduring: The ineffable life of bitterness among rural migrants in Shanghai,"In the Maoist period, the Chinese socialist state encouraged the genre of “speaking bitterness” in order to give expression to past sufferings and cultivate a class consciousness. In the post-Mao era, scholars have noted how marginalized figures express discontent through public displays of bitterness and how state agents use “speaking bitterness” as a governing strategy for diffusing class antagonism and ensuring stability. The communication of bitterness, however, does not necessarily have an intrinsic or performative relationship with political action; it has a social life beyond political governance. Based on my ethnographic research with rural-urban migrants in Shanghai, this article explores the communication of bitterness as an affective and ethical force situated between speaking and enduring. The ineffable gap between speaking and enduring does not mark passivity, but decenters the speaking subject and opens up a social space for criticism, recognition and hope for a different future."
TAXING WEALTH IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD,"An annual wealth tax, a mark-to-market income tax, and a retrospective capital gains tax are three approaches to capital taxation that yield roughly equivalent outcomes under certain conditions. The three approaches differ starkly, however, in their exposure to uncertainty of various types. This essay seeks to highlight the effect of uncertainty on the implementation and operation of alternative capital taxation regimes. An annual wealth tax is highly vulnerable to valuation uncertainty and constitutional uncertainty, but less so to political uncertainty. A retrospective capital gains tax, by contrast, minimizes valuation uncertainty and effectively eliminates constitutional uncertainty but remains highly exposed to political uncertainty. A mark-to-market regime falls somewhere between the two extremes on dimensions of political and constitutional uncertainty but shares in a wealth tax’s exposure to valuation uncertainty. Ultimately, the choice among alternative capital taxation regimes reflects a trade-off among uncertainties of different varieties."
John Locke as a Reader of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan: A New Manuscript,"The following article provides significant new evidence of John Locke’s interest in Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan (1651). The evidence derives from the collection of manuscripts amassed by the historian Thomas Birch (1705–66), the author of The History of the Royal Society of London (1756–57). Within this collection are several documents in the hand of Pierre Des Maizeaux (1672/3–1745), the Huguenot journalist and biographer. In 1718–19, Des Maizeaux set about compiling A Collection of Several Pieces of Mr. John Locke, a posthumous edition of lesser-known works and manuscripts by Locke, edited with the guidance of Anthony Collins (1676–1729). In preparing the volume, Des Maizeaux interviewed one of Locke’s friends, whose recollections he recorded in an anonymized memoir, in French. The article reveals that the anonymous friend was James Tyrrell (1642–1719), one of Locke’s closest acquaintances. Tyrrell’s claim that Locke “almost always” had Hobbes’s Leviathan on his table in Oxford, ca. 1658–67, is one of several in the memoir that revise our understanding of Locke’s intellectual formation and the history of one of his best-known friendships. The article contextualizes and translates the memoir and revisits the debate surrounding Peter Laslett’s relegation of Hobbes’s significance to the development Locke’s political thought."
Ethnographic views of Brazil’s (new) authoritarian turn,"In this introduction to Currents, we argue for the potential of ethnography to aid in understanding the present. Extended periods of fieldwork allow anthropologists that are in the field well before the facts—that is, before significant political events occur—to provide unique frameworks for understanding those events, frameworks that can incorporate conjuncture as it is lived by the subjects in the sceneries being researched into analysis that take into account more long-term processes. Focusing on the current political conjuncture in Brazil and placing it in a comparative perspective, we explore the peculiar position that anthropologists of contemporary Brazil occupy, in which their role in the production of knowledge and their participation in public debates makes them a target for the conservative and reactionary wave that is engulfing the country."
Mobilization and Countermobilization: The Effect of Candidate Visits on Campaign Donations in the 2016 Presidential Election,"Political scientists studying the impact of campaign visits by presidential candidates have come to conflicting conclusions on whether campaigns change voter behavior in even small ways. In this article, we argue that, while scholars have generally interpreted campaign effect results as being unidirectional, the traditional metrics of such effects—polls and aggregate vote results—inherently reflect a net effect combining any potential mobilization of candidates’ supporters, offset by any countermobilization of their opponents. If such countermobilization occurs, weak or null findings in the campaign effects literature may understate or miss the true impact of campaign activities on voter behavior. To assess whether campaign visits produce mixed effects, we measure the extent to which visits by presidential and vice presidential candidates in the 2016 presidential election produced increases in campaign donations in the immediate aftermath of a visit. Our results show that visits by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton inspired their supporters to donate more money than they otherwise would have. However, we also find a considerable level of countermobilization: visits by both Trump and Clinton resulted in an increase in donations to the opposing presidential campaign."
Ritualizing Hierarchy: Power Strategies and Pigeon Catching in Ancient Samoa,"Previous research has demonstrated that the nature of power strategies correlates with the nature of ritual action, and nowhere is political action more important than in Polynesia. Polynesian political systems have served as important comparative examples for the investigation of complex societies, although the nature of some early political systems is not well understood. Through the analysis of the ritual of pigeon catching, the nature of pre-European-contact power strategies in Samoa are inferred in this paper. We demonstrate that Samoan ritual action in pigeon catching was geared toward the legitimization of hierarchical structure instead of simply the power of individual elites. We contend that by legitimizing structures, manifestations of sacred power could be validated and channeled to others for purposes of practical influence. Based on the comparative analysis of pigeon catching, we find that power strategies in Samoa, despite several notable autocratic tendencies, were more corporate than in neighboring Tonga."
Amidst backward-walking somnambulists,"This Currents section provides accounts of Britain’s exit (Brexit) or departure from the European Union (EU)—a decision based on a closely won referendum in June 2016, and declared in January 2020 by the Conservative political party. With few exceptions, the views and experiences of those excluded from dominant narratives of “the people” have not been substantially considered in mainstream nor indeed anthropological debates. Contributors to the section offer (auto)ethnographic perspectives on the legacies and implications of empire, nationalism, racism, cultural diversity, gender, and generational divides made explicit in Brexit phenomena. They range from the trolling of women of color, the repercussions of race and racism in academia, culturally diverse perspectives on resilience, the experiences of those from the European mainland who work in England, and views on the English from a former colony and now EU country, the Republic of Ireland."
Devices and the Designs on Us: Of Dust and Gadgets,"This parallel presentation of dust and devices, as they have appeared in recent history, attempts to illuminate our reliance on technical devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and the like, in the context of wars and shifts in political and economic ideologies. Devices—and their software—get old and require updating (think of iPhone generations). They are eventually consigned to the dustbin. What does the commitment to upgrading reveal about contemporary understandings of history and historical movement? What is progress in the shadow of the device and in the face of environmental disaster at the particulate level? Sites and moments for critical excavation here include Thatcherism and desert wars, the fall of the Berlin Wall, digital imaging systems, the invention of the Cloud and the Internet of Things, the alignment of coffee shops and 24/7 working, and the utopian potential of space hardware"
No Easy Way Out: The Effect of Military Coups on State Repression,"Military coups are often advocated as solutions for ending state-sponsored atrocities. Yet, we know little about coups’ precise consequences. This article estimates the effect of coups on state repression by exploiting the element of chance in whether an attempted coup succeeds or fails. Contrary to popular views of coups as remedies against repressive autocrats, I find no evidence that coups have a pacifying effect on state repression. Rather, coups appear to make matters worse, even when targeting leaders who commit large-scale human rights violations. This article contributes to studies of political violence, authoritarianism, and civil-military relations by resolving a long-standing “good coup versus bad coup” debate. It also advances literature on coups and their consequences through an innovative empirical design that leverages exogenous variation in coup outcomes, combined with an extreme bounds analysis, overcoming conventional challenges of causal inference using observational data."
Not All Elections Are Created Equal: Election Quality and Civil Conflict,"Research on the dangers of democratization has long warned of the potential for elections to spark civil conflict. Yet, this work has remained surprisingly isolated from the burgeoning body of research on electoral integrity. We open the “black box” of elections to theorize how variation in their quality shapes the opportunities and incentives for military conflict. We argue that electoral integrity matters by influencing perceptions about the legitimacy of political outcomes and about actors’ willingness to play by the rules. While high-quality elections should not exacerbate the risk of civil conflict, low-integrity contests foster grievances and decrease the ability of the government and opposition to make credible commitments to avert violence. We find firm support for our hypothesis: flawed presidential elections increase the risk of conflict, especially in countries with a history of civil conflict. These findings are robust to methods to address the endogeneity of elections and electoral quality."
The Closing of the American Constitutional Imagination,"In his relentlessly substantive and intelligent book, The Second Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era, Stanford historian Jonathan Gienapp offers an important contribution to founding scholarship and a fresh and foundational challenge to originalism. Specifically, Gienapp examines how the founders answered the question, what is a constitution? The historical narrative resulting from Gienapp’s research into this question traces the eclipse and eventual replacement of “incomplete” and “unfinished” understandings of constitutional identity with a form of constitutional consciousness he calls “constitutional fixity.” This review essay identifies several contributions of Second Creation and explains how and why it represents a fundamental challenge to originalism. It takes issue, however, with Gienapp’s understanding of the evolution of James Madison’s understanding of constitutional identity and suggests that “constitutional fixity” may have been present in the political thought of the American founders earlier than Gienapp claims."
How Docket Control Shapes Judicial Behavior: A Comparative Analysis of the Norwegian and Danish Supreme Courts,"European courts have responded to increasing caseloads by providing justices or other actors with a higher degree of discretionary docket control. Does docket type—mandatory or discretionary—shape judicial behavior? Using a most similar systems research design regarding tax decisions in the Norwegian and Danish supreme courts, we show that discretionary dockets are associated with higher dissent and reversal rates than mandatory dockets, that low-status litigants have a lower chance of winning under mandatory dockets, and that docket type conditions the effects of justices’ preferences. Our findings have implications for comparative judicial politics and for institutional design."
"Beyond the Reach of Law? Criminal Prosecution of Parisian Police Personnel, 1872–1914","The French Third Republic introduced more guarantees of civil liberties than any previous French regime, yet citizens remained unable to challenge police violence and illegality in court—even though the Penal Code provided a legal basis for prosecuting police misconduct. This article reveals how police managers and the judiciary in Paris collaborated to avoid bringing charges against police personnel. It also highlights the significant role played by French civil liberties activists and organizations, most notably the League of Human Rights, in pushing for more transparency and accountability in policing. While historians of policing have noted the discrepancies between high-minded republican ideals and limitations on citizens’ rights and liberties, they see this as stemming from incomplete republicanization and justify police impunity as necessary for the defense of the Republic and its values. This article argues instead that the continued absence of police accountability to the law was rooted in republican values and priorities themselves. Moreover, the failure to prosecute police placed the French Third Republic increasingly at odds with developments in Britain and Prussia. Finally, it provides the basis for further comparative research into how different political regimes, past and present, respond to citizens’ complaints about police abuses."
How Should We Think about Environmental Policy and Jobs? An Analogy with Trade Policy and an Illustration from U.S. Coal Mining,"Public discussions of environmentally motivated policies include much confusing talk           about job loss. Does job loss in a polluting industry mean that others should endure dirty           air or that complementary policies are needed? To clarify the jobs issue, I use concepts           from research on international trade policy and its effects and apply them to recent job           loss in the U.S. coal industry. The case of coal illustrates the economic adjustment that           could arise from an environmental policy as well as the equity, efficiency, and political           issues that adjustment raises. I show that for each coal job lost, earnings in the           surrounding county fell by nearly $100,000, and that one-third of those who lost jobs did           not move and remained unemployed. On average, the losses affected poorer counties and           exacerbated income disparities between counties. Concurrently, coal county voters shifted           toward pro-coal candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, helping him           win Pennsylvania. More broadly, I argue that environmental adjustment assistance of some           form may improve the equity and political feasibility of environmental policies that           benefit many but harm some. However, the how and when of such assistance requires further           study."
Nazareth Village and the Creation of the Holy Land in Israel-Palestine: The Question of Evangelical Orthodoxy,"This article makes useful for the study of Christianity Talal Asad’s concept of Islam as a discursive tradition. It investigates how a particular theological position and practice, or “orthodoxy,” within evangelicalism is maintained and lived out. Its goal is to highlight evangelical orthodoxy as a relationship of power and explore the ways in which evangelical beliefs and practice are conditioned by and result in social and political consequences. To do this, it explores the example of the living history museum Nazareth Village in Israel-Palestine, developed jointly by American and Palestinian Israeli evangelicals, which reconstructs Jewish first-century life in the center of a Palestinian Israeli town. I argue that Nazareth Village recreates a particular imagination of the biblical first century that animates evangelical imaginations of and investments in what Israel ought to be like today. The powerful theologies that propel it stand in contrast to local Palestinian evangelical ideas of the “Holy Land.”"
Devil’s advocate: Sketch of an amoral anthropology,"This essay polemicizes against contemporary anthropology’s ubiquitous moralism and its demand for engagement. It does so by trying on the glasses of evolutionary theories of moral behavior. If we take Homo sapiens to be a moralistic ape and consider that anthropologists are members of the species they study, their moralizing appears only natural. In the past decade, however, the moral and political landscapes of North America and Europe have changed dramatically, which has provoked a renewed problematization of moral discourse. Like all polemics, this essay proposes an alternative to what it attacks: the possibility of an amoral anthropology, in which the anthropologist plays the role of devil’s advocate. The project refurbishes the ivory tower as a high-containment laboratory for ideas, especially dangerous ideas that we might have good reason to sanction in public."
Self-Enforcing Legal Limits: Bureaucratic Constraints on Repression under Emergency Powers,"Governments of all stripes have attempted to transgress ordinary legal limits and infringe upon rights and liberties under the cover of emergency powers. Are repressive policies adopted under emergency law less likely to comply with extant legal limits, as compared to repressive policies adopted under normal law? What are the mechanisms by which the potential abuse of emergency powers can be constrained? To answer these questions, we develop a game-theoretic model that builds upon the fact that political rulers rely on security agents to execute their repressive policies. We show that rulers always prefer to make policy under emergency law while security agents actually prefer the legal regime that incentivizes rulers to choose a policy more likely to comply with ordinary legal limits. Consequently, there is a potential endogenous constraint on the abuse of emergency powers given that rulers must rely on security agents to implement their repressive decisions."
"Serving the People, Building the Party: Social Organizations and Party Work in China’s Urban Villages","The reform era has been associated with the waning authority of the Chinese Communist Party in urban society. While existing studies have investigated the Party’s self-reinvention through the incorporation into its ranks of professional groups and the new socioeconomic elite, much less attention has been given to how the Party has rebuilt its presence in neighborhoods among urban residents and migrant communities. Drawing on a case study in Kunming, this article argues that the Party has sought to deepen its territorial reach and regain political relevance by emphasizing welfare provision and service delivery at the grassroots. The rise of service-centered Party-building has seen increased co-optation of previously independent social organizations as “partners” and “collaborators” in service provision. Enrolling NGOs enables the Party to both revamp its image as a paternalistic redistributor and regain its ability to mobilize the masses through appropriating the vocabulary of participation and volunteerism that social organizations espouse. If in co-opting the professional and business elite the Party has successfully fused Party authority with market power, at the urban grassroots it has appropriated social forces to reestablish its presence and bolster its legitimacy, with important implications for the autonomy and professionalism of NGOs."
The Messiah and the Jurisconsult: Agamben on the Problem of Law in Sunni Islam,"Although Giorgio Agamben engages Islam at various points in his work, it occupies an ambivalent role in his hypothesis that messianism constitutes the limit concept of the law. This article amplifies that ambivalence in order to explore how centering the shari‘a would confuse certain categorical divisions on which his messianism relies. I first read Islamic apocalyptic traditions with and against Agamben, and then explore messianic temporalities disclosed in the human articulation of divine law. While Agamben’s method organizes Islam alongside the other traditions he engages, the persistence of the Islamic theologico-juridical apparatus instead articulates his political theology as a Christian science."
Words of Common Cause: Social Work’s Historical Democratic Discourse,"The United States’ present neoliberal era shares with earlier tumultuous periods significant repressive tendencies in the political and economic domains. In the past, leading social workers confronted such crises in public forums and venues. This discourse analysis examines how they constructed compelling democratic narratives that influenced the enactment of beneficial social policy within three periods of democratic crisis. These social work leaders were members of presidential administrations, leaders of social work professional associations, directors of civil society organizations, and prominent writers for the profession or the public. They communicated through public and professional speeches, peer-reviewed articles, pamphlets, radio addresses, and congressional testimony. Discourse analysis reveals democratic themes such as autonomy, human dignity, equality, recognition, fostering of human capacity, social responsibility, and the necessity of moral contemplation. The historical lesson is that all social workers today should advance democratic discourse in their areas of influence to stem neoliberalism and promote democracy."
"Craft, War, and Cultural Diplomacy: Modern British Crafts in the United States, 1942–1945","The “Modern British Crafts” exhibition, which toured North America between 1942 and 1945, sheds light on the importance of craft in the development of national and diplomatic ideologies. Presented and received as a legacy of the transatlantic Arts and Crafts movement, the exhibition reinforced an existing tradition of cultural exchange that could stand for a political alliance. Foregrounding craft, domestic space, and the work of women, and echoing images of air raid damage, the exhibition dismantled assumptions that the domestic and the feminine were remote from war and avant-garde art."
“The Camphor Question Is in Reality the Savage Question”: Indigenous Pacification and the Transition to Capitalism in the Taiwan Borderlands (1895–1915),"This article examines the relationship between the Taiwan camphor industry and Japan’s conquest of the island’s Indigenous peoples. Between 1895 and 1915, Japanese police and military forces invaded Taiwan’s Indigenous highlands for control of camphor. At the dawn of the twentieth century, camphor crystals were a vital natural resource used in the production of celluloid, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. The consequences of this single commodity were far reaching, as Japanese pacification armies shelled and burned Indigenous villages to the ground, forcibly relocated tens of thousands, and killed both resistance fighters and innocent civilians. This article looks at the ways in which the productive and consumptive demands of the camphor industry directly shaped the political, military, and ideological structures of imperial governance in upland Taiwan. Through the prism of the Taiwan case, it examines the violent forms of colonial occupation that accompany the imposition of capitalist social relations on native societies."
Figure (of Personhood) Drawing: Scaffolding Signing and Signers in Nepal,"This article explores how the affordances of pictorial representations of sign language forms (as enacted by illustrated signers) impact institutional processes of enskillment to sign language use. First, I attend to the participation framework roles such images inhabit in processes through which deaf teachers work to socialize novice signers to control the viewpoint reversals fundamental to local signing practices. I then explore how novice signers’ participant roles in relation to these images shift as they transition from animating the pictorially represented signs to performing them in ways aimed at yielding identification with the portrayed figures of personhood. Finally, through an analysis of a pictorially illustrated Nepali Sign Language version of Nepal’s new national anthem, I show how the particulars of such figures have shifted in response to dramatic political changes following Nepal’s Maoist Civil War."
On Estimating Personality Traits of US Supreme Court Justices,"Psychological scholarship on personality is uniting with political science to redefine existing theories. This is clearly the case with research on judicial behavior and the US Supreme Court. But if this new approach is to survive and thrive, it must employ measures equal to the task. We show that Supreme Court Individual Personality Estimates, which seek to estimate justices’ personalities by examining their concurring opinions, suffer from a number of important methodological deficits that critically limit their usefulness. We briefly discuss what kinds of improved personality measures scholars should use instead and offer an improved set of estimates for one trait with an application that demonstrates our cautionary tale."
More-Than-Human Histories,"AbstractThis article continues and extends a conversation between environmental history and the broader environmental humanities, outlining and defining an approach to more-than-human histories. Engaging with more-than-human and multispecies approaches in a range of fields within the broader environmental humanities, we point to a nested set of commitments that shape these research agendas. More-than-human histories as articulated here take on three of these commitments in particular: co-constitution; the presencing of multiple species and multiple voices; and situated politics and ethics. These commitments offer meeting points for environmental history and the broader environmental humanities, which can bring them into closer dialogue with a range of mutual benefits as well as raising some challenges for each. The article concludes with a consideration of the methodological implications of this approach, pointing to ways in which a more-than-human approach might allow environmental historians to uncover new sources and approach familiar ones from new angles."
The Double Life of Property: Mobilizing Land and Making Capitalism in Modern France,"Nineteenth-century France was host to a vigorous public debate on how real property—land and buildings—should function in the marketplace. Proponents of what was called the mobilization of land sought to enhance the circulation of real property, whereas its opponents aimed to prevent the dissipation of durable patrimonies in the unreliable world of commerce and finance. This article analyzes the articulation of the mobilization question by jurists, politicians, and political economists in early nineteenth-century France and argues for its importance—and the centrality of real property relations—to understanding the imaginative and institutional construction of modern capitalism. Focusing on contentious innovations in the financial life of real property of the 1789 and 1848 revolutions, it reconstructs the repetitive character of mobilization programs and argues that this mimetic quality stems from a persistent and enduring misapprehension regarding nature and the material as sources of economic value."
The Importance of Candidate Sex and Partisan Preference over Time: A Multiday Study of Voter Decision Making,"Women often face challenges when running for political office, but precisely when and how candidate sex affects voter decision making is unclear. Using a unique multiday, high-information experiment, we examine how the presence of women candidates in an election influences subjects’ information search, candidate evaluations, and vote decisions. We focus on how the partisan alignment of women candidates (whether they run in the subject’s preferred in-party vs. out-party) matters and at which point in the campaign gender is most influential. We find that subjects who see in-party women candidates are more open to considering the out-party candidate, seeking out more information about the candidates in the race. Out-party women candidates strengthen subjects’ initial partisan preferences, however, leading to less search and higher in-party voting rates. We also find that candidate gender is most influential early in the campaign, and its effects diminish as the campaign progresses."
Policy Disagreement and Judicial Legitimacy: Evidence from the 1937 Court-Packing Plan,"Judicial politics scholars are currently engaged in a debate over whether policy disagreement with the Supreme Court causes individuals to view the Court as less legitimate. Traditional legitimacy theory makes the argument that policy incongruence does not affect legitimacy judgments. However, recent research challenges this assertion and demonstrates that incongruence is associated with diminished evaluations of the Court’s legitimacy. I contribute to this debate by analyzing public support for the 1937 Court-packing plan. The Court-packing plan is a unique context in which to test theories of legitimacy because the Court’s institutional structure faced a credible threat. I find that support for New Deal policies predicts support for the Court-packing plan, a desire to see Congress pass the plan, and wanting to limit the Court’s ability to exercise judicial review to invalidate acts of Congress. These results support the emerging notion that policy disagreement is associated with diminished legitimacy."
"“Regarded as an Appendage of His Family”: Slavery, Family, and the Law in Indian Territory","A wealth of historical scholarship exists on how chattel slavery and the stigmatization of Blackness shaped familial bonds, kinship networks, and identity formation among Black and Native people in the Cherokee and Creek Nations. Yet, only one full-length work exists on the institution in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, Barbara Krauthamer’s groundbreaking 2013 monograph, Black Slaves, Indian Masters: Slavery, Emancipation, and Citizenship in the Native American South. This essay expands upon this scholarship with an examination of the lives of enslaved people in Choctaw and Chickasaw communities in nineteenth-century Indian Territory through the lens of family, kinship, and the law. It analyzes how Black and Native people eluded or ignored legal codes that forbid intimate relationships to form family and kinship bonds. In addition, this article demonstrates how the repercussions of both coerced and voluntary relationships during slavery shaped the political and social activism of freedwomen during the emancipation period."
Bureaucratic Weaponry and the Production of Ignorance in Military Operations on Guam,"Militarism is a form of life accomplished in the contemporary world through large institutions organized bureaucratically around the preparation for, and production of, violence. Bureaucracies most famously produce a diffusion of responsibility among their members, but additionally they produce both knowledge and ignorance at both the institutional and the more compartmentalized scales. This article examines the political and cultural uses of ignorance claims and performances by military bureaucracy, taking the example of the US Navy’s environmental impact statement documents produced in the process of building up its presence in the nonsovereign island of Guåhan/Guam. While the documents produced in militarized bureaucratic contexts like this one appear to be claims to expertise, they are striking for how they navigate between knowledge and ignorance, that is, for how they seek some kinds of information and avoid others, how they use bureaucratic rules to set boundaries on what knowledge they will seek and quietly perform, not knowing what they at some level in fact know but do not wish to know. The goal is to understand the ignorance of militarism here not as an obstacle to knowing but as a related phenomenon with its own social shapes and effects."
How Elite Networks Shape Private Enterprises’ Social Welfare Provision in Rural China,"In a context of increased state expectations that Chinese private enterprise will “give back to society,” this article argues that the way that locally developed private enterprises engage in welfare and poverty relief in rural China is decisively shaped by the social networks of the owners. Three very different industrial structures located near to each other in Fanhua County, Shandong Province, are compared. These are: a small group of large conglomerates situated near the county seat, a networked cluster of over 3,000 mostly small and micro furniture companies, and a cluster of midsize companies that produce sheet steel. Industrial structures have shaped the owners’ social networks in each of these three industries. The norms embedded in the businesspeople’s social/business networks, which are affected by the influence on the networks of political authority, factory-owner peers, and ordinary locals, orient the private enterprise owners toward providing or not providing social welfare in particular ways."
Social Realism: The Turns of a Term in the Philippines,"Looking at the legacy of 1970s social realist painting in the Philippines, Patrick D. Flores reflects on the intersection of postcolonial discourse, historical imagination and political art practice."
Everybody Hurts Sometimes: How Personal and Collective Insecurities Shape Policy Preferences,"Understanding when individuals support government action is central to government responsiveness and democratic policy making. While previous research on political behavior has explored the influence of collective economic conditions, self-interested explanations have heavily swayed work on policy preferences. We bridge these two previously distinct literatures to articulate a theory of public policy preferences that highlights when both common and pocketbook factors influence preferences for social insurance. Using a cross-national sample of developed democracies from 1996 and 2006, we conclude that when personal economic conditions are dire, the pull of self-interest trumps both collective and policy concerns."
Moving in Together? Synoikismos and Polis Formation at Sagalassos and in Southwest Anatolia,"Topics such as polis formation and synoikismos have a rich background in classical studies, history, and archaeology. Such studies have mainly focused on the attestations of synoikismos events in literary sources and inscriptions. The archaeological side of such processes has not always been given equal weight. This paper presents a more encompassing view on patterns of synoikismos and polis formation by incorporating and assessing archaeological evidence in a model of push-pull interactions between local communities and the Hellenistic kingdoms in southwest Anatolia. This model will be applied on a case study of the origin of polis at Sagalassos and its relation with the nearby settlement at Düzen Tepe during its formative years in the Early to Middle Hellenistic period (3rd–2nd centuries b.c.). It will then situate this case in its wider context of settlement patterns and community formation in southwest Anatolia, focusing on the ancient regions of Pisidia, Lycia, and Pamphylia. The paper suggests that interactions between local communities and overarching central administrations offered suitable stimuli that resulted in local communities starting to participate in wider dynamics of economic and political importance. This ultimately resulted in observed patterns of polis formation and a potential synoikismos."
The Call of the Homeland: Transnational Education and the Rising Nationalism among Chinese Overseas Students,"This article investigates how the desire for Western credentials and transnational mobility reconcile with strong nationalist sentiments among Chinese students and how Chinese students’ overseas educational experiences are largely structured by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Through a 12-month transnational ethnography study of 15 Chinese students migrating between China’s Pearl River Delta and the US Midwest, I argue that transnational education has become a crucial part of China’s nation-building in the era of intensified globalization. The seemingly contradictory existence of the transnational desire for Western education and rising nationalist sentiments work jointly in the neoliberal market economy to build entrepreneurial individuals, who are expected to contribute to China’s economic growth as well as political rejuvenation. This article reveals that transnationalism is, by no means, the opposing force of nationalism. On the contrary, the movement, mobility, and fluidity endowed by transnationalism could enhance the migrants’ national identity and political intolerance."
"“We Are Farkhunda”: Geographies of Violence, Protest, and Performance","The iconic image of Farkhunda—bloodied, beaten, and pleading for assistance—went viral in March 2015, emblematic of the unfathomable attack and brutal murder of a young woman, a religious student, in broad daylight, in the center of Kabul, Afghanistan. First accused of burning the Qur’an and later exonerated, Farkhunda was transformed from a person to a martyr to a symbol personifying multiple and disparate ideologies. The posthumous proclamation of her innocence positioned her as the perfect victim, ripe for multiple forms of sociopolitical claiming. The spectacles of her death, her funeral, the protests following the act, and the reenactment of her murder imbue her death with meaning while problematically erasing the ordinariness of her life. Drawing on feminist political geography and analysis of gendered violence in Afghanistan, we discuss the social and political geographies of place, embodiment, grief, violence, protest, and performance. Through interviews and content analysis of media coverage, this essay provides sociocultural context and social reflections on the murder, funeral, protests, and dramatic reenactment of Farkhunda’s death. Analyses of these public events elucidate the gendered geographies of embodied and performative expressions of anger, sorrow, and empathy."
The Structure of Legal Doctrine in a Judicial Hierarchy,"Political scientists interested in the structure of legal doctrine are especially attuned to the impact of the judicial hierarchy. They generally frame the issue as whether a higher court will issue a rigid “rule” to prevent shirking or a vague “standard” to give more discretion to lower courts. This “rules versus standards” debate rests on two presumptions: jurists write doctrine, and doctrine varies in flexibility. Using the US Supreme Court, I offer an initial empirical evaluation of these presumptions. The findings reveal that the justices almost always adopt doctrine suggested to them and that these doctrines differ little in flexibility."
Why So Secretive? Unpacking Public Attitudes toward Secrecy and Success in US Foreign Policy,"To what extent does transparency in foreign policy making matter to democratic publics? Scholars and policy makers posit a normative commitment to transparency in the conduct of foreign affairs, an assumption baked into many existing models of international politics. This article tests the existence of a “transparency norm” in international security using three original survey experiments about covert action. I recover attitudes toward covert operations by holding the circumstances and outcomes of conflicts constant and manipulating whether foreign involvement was kept secret from the American public. Then, I unpack an “ends” and “means” trade-off by exploring whether there are conditions under which secrecy in national security is unacceptable to the public, regardless of policy outcomes. The findings demonstrate that democratic publics have only a weak preference for transparency: they care substantially more about the outcomes of US foreign policy rather than the process by which the policy was created."
"“The Sage of Negro Bibliography”: Daniel A. P. Murray, the Librarian as Public Intellectual","Employed at the Library of Congress for more than a half century (1871–1923), Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852–1925) was the institution’s first African American professional. His life and work engage four themes in African American history. First, Murray and his network of public intellectuals debated the most pressing social, political, and cultural issues of the time. Murray scrutinized African American literacy, history, and bibliography, on racial science, and on industrial work. He also embarked upon an African American encyclopedia. Second, Murray’s life and work showed the combustible intersection of class and race that often cleaved the black community as they debated the best strategies to achieve full citizenship in Jim Crow America. Third, as a professional librarian, Murray engaged the public sphere, marshaling his intellectual authority in service of racial uplift. Finally, Murray adds to our understanding of African American social, cultural, professional, and political life in Washington, DC."
Artificial Antisemitism: Critical Theory in the Age of Datafication,"This article is a critical genealogy of Tay, an artificial-intelligence chatbot that Microsoft released on Twitter in 2016, which was quickly hijacked by internet trolls to reproduce racist, misogynist, and antisemitic language. Tay’s repetition and production of hate speech calls for an approach that draws on both media and cultural theory—the Frankfurt School’s dialectical analyses of language and ideology, in particular. Revisiting the Frankfurt School in the age of algorithmic reason shows that, contrary to views foundational to computing, a neural-network chatbot like Tay does not sidestep meaning but rather carries and alters it, with unforeseen social and political consequences. A return to the work of Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno thus locates ideology in the digital world at the nexus of language’s ability to mean, language and meaning’s susceptibility to computation, and the design of a machine to compute both. Coming to critical terms with the antisemitism produced in Tay’s human-computer synthesis requires, as this article contends, addressing the uncanny embodiment and reflection of thought that is digital computation."
The Case of the Nocturnal Amanuenses: New Evidence in the Wat Tyler Affair,"In early 1817 the “Ultra-royalist” Poet Laureate of England, Robert Southey, opened a newspaper and saw an advertisement for a radical play he had written in his “Ultra-jacobin” youth back in late 1794 (the phrases are William Hazlitt’s). “By whose roguery it has got to the press I do not know,” Southey told John Murray. Southey directed his lawyers to initiate a suit in the Court of Chancery requesting an injunction against the publishers on the grounds that “the author has a property in an unpublished work.” But because he had not established his property in the work, the injunction was denied. Furthermore, the Lord Chancellor indicated that his decision was informed by the precedent “that a person cannot recover in damages for a work which is, in its nature calculated to do injury to the public.” The absence of copyright then produced an artificially rapid tranching down in price, flooding the market with cheap editions of the play, while the high-profile affirmation of the precedent provided a certain degree of legal cover for publishers of radical piracies and paved the way for a mass market in radical print. How the play came to be published, however, has remained a mystery. New evidence reveals much of the roguery by which Wat Tyler got to the press and deepens our understanding of political culture, religious Dissent, and publishing practices during the Romantic era."
Open Secrets: The Verbal-Visual Satire of the Anjou Match in Spenser’s Shepheardes Calender,"In 1579 Queen Elizabeth appeared about to marry the Roman Catholic duc d’Anjou, the French king’s brother and heir apparent. Recalling the St. Bartholomew’s Massacre of 1572 in Paris, many English Protestants feared this match, and Spenser’s Shepheardes Calender (1579) satirizes it to stoke resistance. Although the twelve eclogues are illustrated, previous accounts of this satire address only its verbal aspects and focus on “Februarye,” “Aprill,” and “November.” But the picture for “Maye” presents the spurious triumph of a mock-royal couple juxtaposed with a fable of disastrous carelessness while heraldically relating them to the English monarchy. This eclogue climaxes the anti-Anjou satire both visually and verbally and pointedly interacts with the picture and poem for “Aprill” wherein Elizabeth triumphs as England’s virgin queen. As these two eclogues constitute a mutually definitive pair, so consideration of each should be informed by its counterpart. To fulfill the felt responsibilities of his poetic vocation amid acute political and religious challenges, yet elude reprisals, Spenser artfully exploited illustrated poetry’s greater potential for indirect expression, as in emblematics. Yet his intervention was still hazardous as well as potentially rewarding."
Helping or Hurting? How Governing as a Junior Coalition Partner Influences Electoral Outcomes,"Does joining a governing coalition as a junior partner influence a party’s subsequent electoral success? We argue that joining a multiparty cabinet as a junior partner considerably hurts a party’s future electoral prospects as junior partners cannot enact much of what they promised before the election and since they cannot sufficiently differentiate themselves from their larger coalition partner. To test our theoretical expectations comparatively and over time, we have compiled a comprehensive data set on the electoral performance of 307 political parties running in 219 elections in twenty-eight European countries from 1972 to 2017. To shed light on the underlying causal mechanisms, we additionally provide empirical evidence from an illustrative case study showing that the inability to deliver on election promises and a large degree of misperception among voters are important drivers of junior coalition parties’ electoral losses. Our findings provide important insights into the relationship between coalition governments and electoral competition."
Governing Coalition Partners’ Images Shift in Parallel but Do Not Converge,"Research by Fortunato and Stevenson documents that, all else equal, voters infer that governing coalition partners share similar ideologies. All else may not be equal, however, if coalition partners counteract voters’ coalition-based heuristic by publicly emphasizing their policy differences. We argue that coalition partners are motivated to differentiate their policy images, and we review studies documenting these differentiation efforts via party press releases, interviews, speeches, and legislative amendments. We then report analyses of survey data from 21 European party systems that document that, the coalition heuristic notwithstanding, voters displayed only weak and inconsistent tendencies to perceive Left-Right policy convergence between coalition partners. However we argue for—and empirically substantiate—an alternative pattern, namely, that voters perceived coalition partners shifting their positions in the same direction over time, an effect that maintains stable perceived policy distances between parties. These findings have implications for parties’ election strategies and political representation."
"A Dissenting Realism: Style, Ideology, and the American Pre-Raphaelite Movement","A spirit of dissent animated the American Pre-Raphaelites, a movement comprising abolitionist artists and like-minded architects, critics, and scientists. In contrast to their more prominent colleagues, the artists now known as the Hudson River School, the American Pre-Raphaelites established themselves as eloquent critics of slavery and antebellum American society. The group united their political and aesthetic commitments by engaging selected pictorial strategies of the British Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and embracing a radical empiricism. In landscapes, nature studies, and still lifes of modest dimensions, the American Pre-Raphaelites refused compositional conventions that endorsed rank, class, power, and possession by elevating the humble while eschewing the monumental. Through an examination of Thomas Charles Farrer’s View of Northampton from the Dome of the Hospital (1865, Smith College Museum of Art), this article argues that the American Pre-Raphaelites advanced what they viewed as an ethical style of landscape painting—one that assertively announced their abolitionism."
Resistance under the Radar: Organization of Work and Collective Action in China’s Food Delivery Industry,"As services have come to account for an ever growing portion of employment in China, platform-based delivery work has grown exponentially, incorporating millions of workers. Based on a study of food-delivery company Ele.me, we first provide a detailed account of the structure of the platform-based food delivery industry, as well as worker grievances and resistance. While Ele.me workers are subjected to algorithmic control and intensive evaluation, the subcontracting structure of employment presents workers with new forms of leverage. Workers engage in quiet, small-scale, and WeChat-mediated strikes that target the subcontractors who are their direct employers, a phenomenon distinct from the occasional acts of collective resistance among food couriers in other countries. While these strikes have limitations in advancing worker interests, we show how labor unrest has emerged among such workers despite an increasingly constrained political environment and a high degree of online censorship."
"Historicizing “Indian Systems of Knowledge”: Ayurveda, Exotic Foods, and Contemporary Antihistorical Holisms","Some recent authors have argued that “Indian Systems of Knowledge,” such as Ayurvedic medicine, cannot be historicized. They argue that Ayurvedic medicine must be understood as a “system” and with reference to its “metaphysical foundations.” Food has often played an important part in these antihistoricist arguments about traditional South Asian medicines. In this article, I first describe and historicize these antihistoricisms by delineating both their colonial origins and their recent nationalist appropriations. I also argue that history of science needs to distinguish between different types of antihistoricisms emerging from different academic and political contexts. I then move on to show how food history actually can be deployed to subvert these antihistoricist claims. I pursue three interrelated inquiries to support my case. First, I demonstrate that the category of “food” is inappropriate for the textual heritage of Ayurveda, and that we need to be more sensitive to specific technical categories, such as anupana, pathya, and dravya, within which foodstuffs were accommodated. Second, I demonstrate that new foods, especially exotic New World foods, were absorbed into each of these technical categories recognized in Ayurveda. Finally, I show that these new foods did not simply leave the categories themselves untouched. The embodied experiences of the scholar-physicians’ palates substantially transformed the allegedly disembodied, ahistorical categories they wrote about. I argue, then, that far from being an ahistorical fossil as the proponents of antihistorical arguments would have us believe, Ayurvedic medicine was a rich, heterogeneous, and historically dynamic tradition, and food history is singularly well placed to testify to that dynamism."
What Makes Anticorruption Punishment Popular? Individual-Level Evidence from China,"How does punishment of corruption help to build public support in authoritarian regimes? We outline two primary mechanisms. Instrumentally, the ability to pursue anticorruption initiatives to the end signals government capacity. Deontologically, anticorruption punishment signals moral commitments. Through a novel experiment design for mediation analysis embedded in a series of conjoint experiments conducted in China, we find individual-level evidence to support both mechanisms. Specifically, we find that Chinese citizens positively view local government officials who punish their corrupt subordinates and that this positive view arises out of the perception that these officials are both competent in their jobs and morally committed to citizens’ value. The preference for anticorruption punishment is substantial compared to other sources of public support in authoritarian regimes—economic performance, welfare provision, and institutions for political participation—suggesting that it could become a popular strategy among autocrats."
"Income Inequality and Congressional Republican Position Taking, 1913–2013","McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal write about the century-long relationship between national income inequality and congressional partisan polarization: rising income inequality corresponds to more polarization. I question this relationship. First, income inequality correlates more strongly with Republican positioning than with polarization, even before Republicans moved asymmetrically rightward. Second, holding the Republican position fixed, leftward movement of congressional Democrats corresponds to decreasing inequality. Consistent with these empirical facts, I explore substantive evidence that (1) suggests that a Republican-centered explanation plausibly runs in either causal direction but (2) casts doubt on whether polarization driven by Democratic extremism contributes to or is fostered by rising income inequality. Given the prominence of McCarty et al.’s argument in scholarship and the commentary on American politics it informs, this observation is central for understanding how politics shapes and responds to income inequality."
Enslaved Labor and Cultural Capital: A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Copley’s Colonial Patrons and Their Circum-Atlantic World,"Using the tools of economic analysis and art history, this article analyzes John Singleton Copley’s colonial portraits as goods in an imperial economy anchored, in part, in the transatlantic slave trade. A public-facing database details the relationship each sitter had to the institution of slavery, and the text explains how and why Copley’s portraits of them speak to this largely unrepresented context. In commissioning portraits of themselves as wealthy individuals, the sitters transmuted Black enslaved labor into white cultural capital. This finding reveals the racial politics of the culture of gentility and the imbricated economic histories of art and slavery."
Military Coalitions and Crisis Duration,"Forming a military coalition during an international crisis can improve a state’s chances of achieving its political goals. We argue that the involvement of a coalition, however, can have unintended adverse effects on crisis outcomes by complicating the bargaining process and extending the duration of crises. This argument suggests that crises involving coalitions should be significantly longer than crises without coalitions. However, other factors that affect crisis duration are also likely to influence coalition formation. Therefore, taking into account the endogeneity of the presence of a coalition is essential to testing our hypothesis. To deal with this inferential challenge, we develop a new statistical model that is an extension of instrumental variable estimation in survival analysis. Our analysis of 255 post–World War II interstate crises demonstrates that, even after accounting for the endogeneity of coalition formation, military coalitions tend to extend the duration of crises by approximately 284 days."
Why Elites Rebel: Elite Insurrections during the Taiping Civil War in China,"Insurrection of local elites in the early modern era is often regarded as the result of structural contradictions between the expanding state and elites or of preexisting cleavages among elites, but these models cannot address cases in which preexisting, structural cleavages were less evident. This article instead proposes a dynamic, relational model to explain why initially counterinsurgent elite-led militias became rebels during the Taiping Civil War in mid-19th-century China. It argues elite insurrection was an unintended consequence of the countermobilization of the state and elites in reaction to the rising Taiping rebels. By considering insurgent formation as the emergent and endogenous result of iterative interactions of multiple actors, this processual, relational model can be applied to explain many historical and contemporary insurgent wars. Hence, it moves beyond structural determinism and stochastic contingency in offering a sequential approach to the studies of contentious politics and historical change."
State Violence and Wartime Civilian Agency: Evidence from Peru,"How civilians respond to political violence profoundly shapes conflict processes and the legacies of civil war. Yet influential patterns of wartime civilian agency remain strikingly unexplored. This study investigates how exposure to state violence influences the organization of ordinary citizens into civil defense forces, a common and consequential type of mobilization that is still poorly understood. I argue that state violence marked by direct and collective targeting promotes community-based armed mobilization through the mechanisms of signaling and the militarization of local governance in irregular civil war. The analysis focuses on the Peruvian armed conflict during the 1980s. Based on an instrumental variable and a difference-in-differences approach, the results suggest that communities victimized by state forces were more likely to rise up against the insurgents at later stages. These counterintuitive findings underscore the relevance and complexity of grassroots collective action during war."
"Headless queues: Disorder and disorientation in a Zimbabwean market, 2007–2008","In this paper, I analyze Zimbabweans’ efforts to make sense of ubiquitous queues for basic goods during a period of record-breaking hyperinflation. My discussion draws on a series of daily journal entries kept by a resident of the urban informal economy during 2007 and 2008. Besides opening a window onto everyday life amid economic collapse, his journals show how economic and political turmoil was registered in mundane actions (like standing in queues and buying goods on the black market) and perceived violations of established moral geographies and social processes. He framed this experience using common-sense notions of disorder, which were themselves internal to ideas and practices of ordered hierarchy. For him and for many others, then, the country’s so-called “crisis” registered less in explicit historical narrative than in perceptions of reversal and absence."
Casual Contact and Ethnic Bias: Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan,"What determines how contact with the out-group affects behavior? We show experimentally that casual interethnic contact in a postconflict society can increase ethnic bias. Day laborers in Kabul, Afghanistan, were equally altruistic toward their in-group and their out-group when out-group members were not physically present. When out-group members were physically present in an environment where no guidance for interaction or explicit incentives for cooperation were given, out-group altruism was decreasing in time among those who did not speak the out-group’s language, suggesting that this contact highlights differences in descent-based attributes and increases in-group identification. We provide evidence for a psychological mechanism leading to in-group bias in casual, everyday interactions in a postconflict society, with implications for studying the nature of ethnic bias in political and economic behavior. Results suggest that interethnic interaction does not automatically improve ethnic relationships, and attention should be paid to the conditions under which interaction occurs."
Muddy Waters: The Micropolitics of Instructional Coaches’ Work in Evaluation,"Instructional coaching has emerged as a popular policy lever for improvement efforts in an era of teacher evaluation. In this environment, coaches often face conflicting demands between their educative duties to develop teachers and their reform-oriented responsibilities to implement district policy. Coaches can wield facets of teacher evaluation to promote coherent instructional improvement. Drawing on interview data from 41 coaches across five educational systems, we apply the micropolitics perspective to examine coaches’ work as they navigate the intersection of teacher evaluation and instructional improvement. Our findings elucidate two major micropolitical strategies: convergence and divergence. In particular, coaches frequently converged their work with evaluation around goal setting and observation feedback, facilitating teachers’ and administrators’ understanding of the evaluation system and instructional reform. Conversely, coaches tended to separate issues of teachers’ formal ratings from their coaching. Our analysis reveals details on coaches’ political role and illuminates benefits and limitations of coaches’ involvement in evaluation."
Italy as a national luxury brand for Chinese consumers: Global promotion and identity discontent,"Italy has emerged as a leading producer of luxury goods on the international stage, while China has been asserting itself as a strategic market for luxury firms. Italy took advantage of the World Expos, in both Shanghai and Milan, to redefine its relationship with China. What do Chinese people consume when they buy an Italian product? They consume the images produced by Italian trade agencies and marketing services. This narrative, based on the image of consumption, is the product of a construction that has its roots in the Fascist era. The political implications of such nation branding are analyzed by confronting both the present and the past. An analysis of both the genealogy of the global Italian landscape promoted by commercial diplomacy and the protests that surrounded the opening of the Italian World Expo calls into question the transformation of nationalism in a global setting: Italy as it emerges in the Italian-Chinese interface is fetishized; a sense of inauthenticity is created among the Italians."
Making the Nēnē Matter: Valuing Life in Postwar Conservation,"AbstractIn 1950, a group of scientists and public figures, based in Hawaii and England, launched a transnational “restoration project” to save the nēnē or Hawaiian goose from extinction. Scrutinizing this project highlights how endangered species were valued as part of a historically contingent process that reflected and linked the interests of different groups. People did not undertake the restoration project simply because they realized the nēnē were endangered, but, instead, they sought to rescue it at the “eleventh hour” in order to legitimize the new conservation organizations that they helped establish after the Second World War. They also engaged with broader political and socioeconomic concerns to justify the restoration project, publicly framing the nēnē as a valuable asset that benefited Hawaii’s tourist economy and push for statehood. Disputes over the reintroduction of geese bred in England highlight how the nēnē were valued in complex and sometimes contradictory ways, with unforeseen consequences for both the restoration project and its animal subjects. This case study ultimately draws our attention to the inherently biopolitical nature of modern conservation, by showing that there is no simple trajectory from endangered life to valued life."
"Transfers: A Deductive Approach to Gifts, Gambles, and Economy at Large","This paper reinterprets core issues in economic anthropology by exploring transfers as a theoretical resource. After describing deliberate usage of the term “transfer” in anthropology and economics, transfers are defined as movements of economic matter, while transactions are the forms arising from their configuration. Transactional categories such as Maussian gift exchange or market exchange become second-order reifications. Examining the politics of creating and sustaining transactional categories by first looking at the elementary transfers out of which they are constructed places “one-way transfers” of wealth on the same conceptual plane as reciprocal and market transactions, instead of being a derivative or a remainder of either or both. Gifts and gambling are considered as examples. Gambling and “pure gifts” are one-way transfers engineered to possess only one component transfer, and Maussian gifts explicitly connect transfers together in a particular politics. Anthropological literature that employs an incipient version of the transfer strategy is detailed, demonstrating its nascent explanatory promise. The article concludes by suggesting renewed engagement with contemporary economics on the basis of transfers."
"Introduction: Language, Sound, and the Humanities","Presenting the joint historical and methodological framework of the theme issue “Sounds of Language—Languages of Sound,” this introduction situates the individual contributions within a broader history of the humanities. The eight contributions address the period between approximately 1890 and 1970—from the modern disciplinary formation of knowledge about sound and the rise of the social sciences and humanities to the beginnings of computerized sound research. During this period, disciplines as diverse as linguistics, musicology, history, sociology, law, and theology all aspired to give scholarly attention to sound, and in particular to the spoken word. Starting from the observation that late nineteenth-century scholars of language turned from expert readers of historical texts into expert listeners to living languages, we trace the dual use of language as an object and a tool of knowledge production. As a research theme, language often broke through frontiers between the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences, as well as between academic and nonacademic domains of knowledge. At the same time, new languages and modes of speaking arose as tools to examine, represent, and utilize sonic phenomena—whether in speech, music, or other sonic environments. The theme issue’s three claims are, first, that sound both enabled and necessitated new alliances between otherwise divergent fields of knowledge; second, that sound and language motivated humanities scholars to reconsider or even reinvent their methodologies; and, third, that research on sound and language was deeply permeated by issues of power and politics."
Phantom Services: Deflecting Migrant Workers in China,"As China urbanizes, more migrants need and expect public services. Many municipalities, however, resist and undermine elements of the central government’s urbanization strategy by deflecting demands for benefits instead of meeting them or denying them outright. Urban authorities sometimes do so by establishing nearly impossible eligibility requirements or requiring paperwork that outsiders struggle to obtain. At times they also nudge migrants to seek health care or education elsewhere by enforcing dormant rules or by shutting down a locally available service provider. Local officials use these ploys for both political and practical reasons. Limiting access isolates and disempowers migrants and is cheaper than offering benefits. Phantom services are a consequence of the localization of the household registration system (hukou 户口) and a sign that new axes of inequality and gradations of second-class citizenship have emerged."
Expanding Water Markets in the Western United States: Barriers and Lessons from Other Natural Resource Markets,"This article identifies key barriers to the expansion of surface water markets in the western United States and examines the lessons learned from the development of market-based management of other resources. We argue that the most salient barriers to water market development are conducting and verifying trades of environmental goods and services and the challenges associated with the political economy of defining, altering, and transferring property rights. We review the extensive economics literature on markets for fishing rights, air pollution abatement, and water quality; discuss the lessons learned from experience with these markets; and suggest specific reforms for increasing the role of markets in water resource management, including minimizing the cost of trades and implementing strategies to address political opposition."
Big Data Justice: A Case for Regulating the Global Information Commons,"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) challenges political theorists to think about data ownership and policy makers to regulate the collection and use of public data. AI producers benefit from free public data for training their systems while retaining the profits. We argue against the view that the use of public data must be free. The proponents of unconstrained use point out that consuming data does not diminish its quality and that information is in ample supply. Therefore, they suggest, publicly available data should be free. We present two objections. First, allowing free data use promotes unwanted inequality. Second, contributors of information did not and could not anticipate that their contribution would be used to train AI systems. Our argument implies that managing the “global information commons” and charging for extensive data use is permissible and desirable. We discuss policy implications and propose a progressive data use tax to counter the inequality arising."
Sustainability enclaves in Southeast Asia,"Resource regimes in postsocialist Laos have been dominated by foreign actors in ways that frequently dovetail with the prerogatives of multilateral investment and the work of nongovernmental development organizations. A common theme among these diverse actors is that the Lao government regularly delegates certain kinds of governing activity to these foreign actors, resulting in specific territories over which foreign organizations can frequently play a dominating role, albeit in highly diverse and idiosyncratic ways. Following on Ong’s concept of graduated sovereignty, I term these governance regimes sustainability enclaves, noting that they frequently revolve around resource extraction, and that “sustainability” broadly construed characterizes contestation over how development should take place. Sustainability enclaves are the outcome of a postsocialist policy of cautious openness toward foreign actors. They involve specific but heterogeneous governance regimes that can and frequently do overlap. They often have important effects on the dilemmas of everyday life for those who live within their domain, while they also characterize the practicalities of state management of foreign organizations operating in the country."
Reproducing Racial Fictions: Critical Meditations on (a) Lesbian Pregnancy,"This essay meditates on the incoherence of the history of race and family through the lens of contemporary lesbian pregnancy. The presence of two mothers—in this case, one white and one black—alongside the simultaneous irrelevance and hyperrelevance of paternity tugs at the tangled American historical threads of race and family in ways that ultimately surface a variety of fantasies that shape both. Here I consider the ways that lesbian reproduction makes legible, and complicates, the historical feminization and racialization of reproduction, given that the extraneousness of paternity underscores at once a kind of chosen paternity, the necessity of paternity, and the irrelevance of paternity. If the double-mother scenario invokes the tiresome “who’s the father?” question, in which heteronormative models of familiality assert themselves even in the scene of queer kinship formations, then the real shadow of lesbian reproduction is another question: “Who’s the (real) mother?” I argue that the scene of lesbian pregnancy exposes histories and fictions of race, kinship, and legitimacy, and ultimately raises and recalls tensions between the political impulses of queerness and the histories of race."
Seeing water: Slow resistance and the material enigma of extractive effects on society and ecology,"This article reflects on ten years of ethnographic work investigating concerns about mining industry-produced environmental and social change in hyperarid territories experiencing long-term drought. The ecological and social effects of groundwater extraction by the copper and lithium mining industry in the southern Salar de Atacama are not immediately detectable, since water, the saltpan, and the desert provide few clues, and the political and economic conditions of water in Chile render it fractured between surface and subsurface, fresh and salt. In public accounts, water belongs to a radical present: there are few environmental reports of water’s past before groundwater was profoundly subject to mining, and ecological impacts from aquifer extraction are apparent only after exhaustion has occurred. This article takes a narrative approach that reflects on what may be achieved by “slow resistance” and discerned from accumulated ethnographic witnessing."
Reusable and Nonreusable Films: From Ballistic Films to the Encyclopaedia Cinematographica,"The film Fracture Phenomena in Glass is a noteworthy case of a film reuse: it was published in the Encyclopaedia Cinematographica (EC) in 1976, bearing the signature E 2355. In this instance, surprisingly, the Institut für den Wissenschaftlichen Film (Institute for Scientific Film [IWF]), which produced, edited, distributed, and archived the EC films, reused ballistic film recordings from World War II. Produced at the Ballistic Institute of the Berlin-Gatow Air War Academy in 1942–1943 under the direction of Hubert Schardin, they were first published in 1944 as C 433 by the National Socialist predecessor institution, the Reich Institute for Film and Images in Science and the Classroom (Reichsanstalt für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht [RWU]). This reuse suggests that at least some of the EC films bear witness to telling discrepancies in political, historical, and epistemological classification within a distinctive worldwide project of postwar visual film research. This essay considers the controversial role of the encyclopedist Gotthard Wolf and the institutional history of the RWU/IWF by looking at examples of the reuse—or nonreuse—of ballistic films and concepts."
Engineering Informal Institutions: Long-Run Impacts of Alternative Dispute Resolution on Violence and Property Rights in Liberia,"Informal institutions govern property rights and disputes when formal systems are weak. Effective informal institutions should help people reach and maintain bargains, minimizing violence. Can outside organizations engineer persistent institutional change? Will this strengthen property rights and investment? We experimentally evaluate a United Nations and civil society mass education campaign to promote alternative dispute resolution practices and norms in rural Liberia, where violent land disputes are common. Prior work showed a drop in violence and unresolved disputes within one year. We return after three years to test for sustained impacts and mechanisms. Treated communities report large, persistent drops in violent disputes and a slight shift toward nonviolent norms. Treated residents also report larger farms, although overall effects on property rights and investment are mixed. Politically connected residents report more secure property rights, while those with fewer connections feel less secure. Sustained institutional engineering is feasible, but politics shapes distributional outcomes."
"When Ghosts Appear: Migrant Workers, Fears of Haunting, and Moral Negotiation in a Chinese Electronics Factory","This article discusses the haunting of a factory in Shenzhen, China. The haunting coincided with the 2008 global financial crisis that resulted in a decline in factory orders, leaving the workers, mostly migrants from the countryside, idle. With the appearance of ghosts, the workers found a cultural language that indirectly expressed their anxiety about future undisclosed measures to restructure the factory. In the end, the factory owner was forced to come forward to deal with the ghosts by performing a customary folk ritual. Starting from this scenario, it will be shown how claiming to see ghosts constitutes a political act and reveals practices within a modern factory that engage in a “moral economy” mutuality between management and workers. Through this, people in the factory gained bargaining power built upon reciprocity and social debts and were able to articulate their concerns using a supernatural system of meaning. By way of the ghost panic, they created room for corrective action even in a difficult situation."
Trust in Public Policy Algorithms,"Algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in many areas of public policy. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the degree of trust individuals are willing to place in these algorithms. This article reports on a series of experiments on trust in algorithms for forecasting political events and criminal recidivism. Contrary to previous literature on algorithm aversion, we find that people show high levels of trust in algorithms relative to other sources of advice, even with minimal information about the algorithm. We also explore evaluation of combined human and algorithm advice. We find that, when experts make decisions in light of algorithm advice, the relative weight given to their judgments increases, but the algorithm’s guidance is not disregarded. Finally, using a conjoint experiment, we evaluate the factors that influence people’s preferences for algorithms, finding that risk aversion, data size, human in the loop, and developer reputation play an important role in engendering trust."
"A New Genealogy of “Intelligent Rage,” or Other Ways to Think about White Women in Feminism","Rage, we argue, has been vividly constructed in multiple academic and popular feminist forums as specifically directed at white women. White women are both the object of rage and the readership that must witness “eloquent rage”—and perhaps even be disciplined by it—in order to transform themselves into good feminist political subjects. In this essay, we examine Black feminist constructions and uses of “intelligent rage” alongside other moments of feminists’ reckoning with the problematic object of white women in order to contextualize rage and to make visible the long genealogy of reckoning with white women’s bad object status in feminism."
An Economic Perspective on Water Security,"Water security involves multiple interrelated policy challenges that economists often analyze separately. This article examines the issue of water security from an economic perspective, identifying economic causes and consequences of infrastructure financing deficits, water misallocation, and water risks. To help address these challenges, we review trends in defining and measuring water security and present an economic framework for assessing the costs and benefits of policies aimed at enhancing water security. We show that policies aimed at increasing water security to meet basic water needs, ensure more equitable water distribution, or reduce water risks rarely align with conventional measures of economic efficiency. We argue that water security requires strengthening and coordinating institutions to address multiple objectives and that these institutional arrangements are polycentric in nature, balancing decentralized decision-making with coordination across sectors and political borders. The issue of water security underscores why economists need to take institutions more seriously if they are to provide credible analyses of policy responses to water management challenges."
Making and Marking Maleness and Valorizing Violence: A Bioarchaeological Analysis of Embodiment in the Andean Past,"The unmarked category of man and claims of innate violence have been tightly linked in the public imagination and in much scholarly work, both in views of the past and the present and in how those temporalities mutually inform one another. However, these notions of the naturally violent man eschew the evidence showing how social, political, and other processes interact to make and mark gender and connect narratives about violence with gender and other aspects of identity. Drawing on examples from the pre-Hispanic and early Spanish colonial Andean world, I explore how (bio)archaeology investigates both overt physical violence and structures of violence that can be hidden yet are deeply impactful. This kind of analysis places the archaeological body at the core, also interrogating how norms about violence become embodied. Through a consideration of this constructive process, I examine the corporal effects of various narratives about violence, gender, and the body in the (pre)historic Andes. These (bio)archaeological and ethnohistoric data are also examined to scrutinize how these stories of past violence are used in the service of normalizing and naturalizing (male) violence today."
"Ragtime, Clockwork: Community Work, Mobility, and Chronotope Production in Amazonian Communities","Inhabitants of Gurupá, a rural municipality in the Brazilian Amazon, routinely move between economic, social, and territorial systems that order community spheres, the Brazilian state apparatus, and global networks. Each of these comes encumbered with temporalities and spatialities that differentially parse space and time. Drawing upon my ethnographic fieldwork, I examine how chronotopes are made, and remade, in a place where community commitments are paramount. Through planning and calculation of urgency and priority, Gurupaenses make strategic choices to achieve calibration between Clockwork and community time. By waiting or leaving, hurrying or lingering, and by choosing the object, mode, and speed of motion, actors independently and communally “flex” time, constructing a Ragtime temporality in which some intervals are stretched and others compressed. In so doing, actors strategically navigate these theoretically incommensurable chronotopes, thus meeting immediate and long-term needs and attending to the social, economic, and political demands of both worlds."
The Greatest Emancipator: Abolition and Empire in Tsarist Russia,"This article offers an original interpretation of the famous Russian Emancipation of 1861 as part of a broader imperial process affecting not just Russian serfs but also numerous other categories of unfree people within the Russian Empire over the long nineteenth century. In addition, it links the history of serf reform within Russia to Russian antislavery politics in the international arena, arguing that all these registers—the imperial and the national, the domestic and the foreign—were intimately connected in the Russian emancipation enterprise, thus placing what is typically understood as a Russian national story into a wider intellectual and geographical framework."
Learning from Biased Research Designs,"Most contemporary empirical work in political science aims to learn about causal effects from research designs that may be subject to bias. We provide a Bayesian framework for understanding how researchers should approach the general problem of inferring causal effects from potentially biased research designs. Our core contention is that any sincere claim that a research design contains bias entails a belief about what that bias is. Once this belief is specified (along with a prior belief about the causal effect), what one should learn from a potentially biased estimate can be derived from Bayes’s rule. We apply this principle to explore when we should learn more or less from basic difference of means estimates and then extend our analysis to speak to several methodological debates and practical problems confronting applied researchers."
Can Rescue Narratives Save Lives? Honor Killing in Pakistan,"This essay closely examines the gendered discourse of shame, honor, violence, and sexuality as played out in Pakistan. The first half of the essay contextualizes the epistemological melee that has marked some post-9/11 feminist scholarship on honor violence. The essay argues that the prescription to regard honor crimes as deculturalized domestic violence, or as severed from Islamic discourse, is unhelpful. Through a conversation with a landowner who rescues women accused of breaching honor codes in southern Pakistan, the essay documents the complex interlocutions of formal and informal laws and the sexual agency and subversion that underscore these dynamics. The landowner’s experiences confirm that delinking honor crimes from cultural practice in Muslim contexts is counterintuitive and that effective resolutions can emerge from traditional sites of localized patriarchy. The essay asks if, in our preoccupation to speak back to empire on behalf of Muslim men, we have jettisoned the opportunity to understand the survival skills of women in Muslim contexts or to assert a feminist politics that could subvert shame and honor-based violence in more pragmatic ways."
"Nobodies and somebodies: Power, bureaucracy, and citizenship in a London rehousing hub","This article draws on ethnographic research to examine the bureaucratic matrix of temporal, material, and legal scales that come together to constitute the rehousing process for a group of rough sleepers seeking passage out of homelessness in contemporary London. Further, it explores the ways in which different bureaucratic technologies mediate the relations between the rehousing hub’s staff, its homeless clients, and local housing authorities, paying particular attention to the way these economies solidify the already asymmetrical power relations that existed between the homeless and those employed to manage them. For the homeless, this process is constituted by a spatiotemporality of confinement and seemingly endless waiting that shunts them into the margins of citizenship, caught between being a nobody and a somebody. Thinking through contemporary debates in political theory, this article approaches the rehousing process (or failure thereof) not as a linear pathway but as a constellation of disciplinary and bureaucratic procedures within which exceptional structures of sovereignty and neoliberal governmentality intersect. Applying these ideas anthropologically, I demonstrate how this intersectionality works to continually shape and reshape the existential realities, possibilities, and aspirations of the hub’s homeless clients."
Rising tides and anthropological morals,"Drawing on debates in southern African anthropology, I suggest that where knowledge claims themselves are in question, comparison, uncertainty, and play may be critical in reframing debates about the relation between anthropology and moral worlds, including anthropology’s own."
The Desegregation of Sportsman’s Park in St. Louis: Black Baseball Fans’ Use of the National Pastime to Fight White Supremacy,"This article examines the desegregation of Major League Baseball (MLB) from a new angle. Much has been written about Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier on the field in 1947, but little is known about fans breaking similar barriers in the stands. From 1920 to 1953, Sportsman’s Park in St. Louis was home to two MLB teams, and, for most of that time, Black fans were not permitted in the grandstands. In 1944, the two teams dropped their segregated seating policy due to decades of activism by Black fans, the influence of World War II, and the efforts of a city-sponsored interracial committee formed to prevent urban unrest. Activist fans cared about desegregating Sportsman’s Park because sitting in the grandstand would allow them to demonstrate their middle-class status, which, through the politics of respectability, they hoped would further their efforts to gain access to civil rights in other arenas."
Early Tracking and Social Inequality in Educational Attainment: Educational Reforms in 21 European Countries,"This article studies socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment in 21 European countries for cohorts born between 1925 and 1989, and asks the question whether reforms to track students later in the school career have reduced inequalities. Country fixed effects models show that inequalities by parental occupational class were reduced after policies were implemented that separated children for different school careers at a later age (i.e., postponed between-school tracking). The association between parents’ education and children’s attainment is hardly affected by reforms to later tracking. The results remained after taking into account the political climate preceding reforms, and were also highly robust to the selection of countries. A reduction of inequality was achieved through a loss of attainment by the children of advantaged backgrounds. Political implications and the relevance of these findings for American debates are discussed."
Latinos’ Knowledge of the Supreme Court,"There is convincing evidence that Americans have high, stable levels of knowledge about the Supreme Court. Yet, this conclusion masks variance in political knowledge associated with ethnicity. Using data from surveys of Latinos and non-Latinos fielded before and after the Supreme Court’s rulings in Arizona v. United States and National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, we find Latinos know less about the Court than other Americans. However, Latinos’ knowledge of the Court increased significantly between the surveys, while others’ Supreme Court knowledge did not. We discuss the implications of this result for the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and civic education policy."
Advisors to Elites: Untangling Their Effect,"Because decision making is complicated, political elites seek advice when making decisions, and the ways in which they use that advice has systematic features. But, analyses of decision making among elites usually fail to account for advice. We take advantage of unique information about the advice provided to one set of elites to empirically uncover the effect of advice. Specifically, we examine law clerk recommendations on cert to Justice Blackmun. We find that, even after controlling for known determinants of cert and considering sequential decision making, the advice of a trusted advisor matters greatly."
Disputed Elections in Presidential Democracies: Contexts of Electoral “Blackmail”,"This study examines the global phenomenon of postelection disputes within presidential democracies. By using an original data set of 164 presidential elections held from 1974 to 2012 in 31 democracies spanning the Americas, Africa, and Asia, two-stage regression modeling was conducted. Comparative case studies from Indonesia and Venezuela were used to explain why and how losers challenged election outcomes. The results showed that challenges occurred equally under conditions of low and high election quality and varying autonomy of election management bodies. However, the presence of constitutional rules and institutional adjudication mechanisms influenced their institutional or noninstitutional routes. Importantly, postelection disputes were not necessarily instigated by fraud. They were more likely to occur when runner-up parties had unfavorable negotiating positions within Congress and therefore resorted to blackmail of the new government to acquire short-term power enhancing benefits beyond the electoral arena in exchange for political stability."
Artistic Process and Domestic Labor in Liza Lou’s Kitchen,"Liza Lou’s Kitchen (1991–96) is a work that is about domestic labor, specifically the maintenance work that happens in kitchens, and it is also about making the artist’s own labor manifest. To create this 168-square-foot installation, Lou constructed a replica kitchen and covered every surface with beads, each placed with tweezers and glue. This essay articulates how Lou’s experimental method of beadwork embeds themes of labor and time in relation to the politics of domesticity. Kitchen shares in the 1990s trends in feminist art that investigated historical conditions of labor through nontraditional artistic processes. It also employs then-familiar imagery of twentieth-century advertising, brand labels, and other visual culture to comment on the role of “housewife.” But rather than simply issuing a straight-forward critique, Kitchen reimagines the role of care—the value of attention and maintenance—through its decorative overabundance."
Speaking for a State: Standardized Kichwa Greetings and Conundrums of Commensuration in Intercultural Ecuador,"Can Indigenous language use transform state politics? In Ecuador, speakers of Kichwa (Ecuadorian Quechua) head a national, intercultural bilingual school system that promotes and teaches Indigenous languages. In their professional roles, they give speeches during which they speak as national state agents. Most commonly, they begin such events by using standardized Kichwa to greet and welcome attendees and then switch to Spanish. Although brief, such greetings serve to mark the state as intercultural. However, they also make Kichwa commensurate with Spanish. Speakers encounter a conundrum in how more extensive or illegible Kichwa speech may not demonstrate a modernist, commensurate form of Kichwa for non-Indigenous-identifying addressees and may even trigger anxiety or censure from Ministry of Education higher-ups. Yet, Kichwa state agents simultaneously risk angering Kichwa-speaking addressees with intralinguistic shift and restricting a movement to reclaim a language to curtailed speech acts within extensive non-Kichwa (Spanish) speech, further prioritizing that language and addressees who speak it. Their dilemmas indicate the challenges of language standardization in recognition politics and illustrate how semiotic processes of entextualization and enregisterment are integral to commensuration."
“Girl” in Crisis: Colonial Residues of Domesticity in Transnational School Reforms,"Investment in girls’ education is offered as a salve to the Global South that will alleviate poverty, prevent terrorism, and curb gender-based violence. Rather than treat this thesis and its evidentiary basis as axiomatic, we examine some of the conditions for the intelligibility of this crisis, prevalent in much international development and education reform discourse today. Archival study of transnational school reforms in Kenya Colony—specifically the Jeanes School in the 1920s and 1930s and Mau Mau prison camp reeducation in the 1950s and 1960s—makes visible how domesticity has offered a shifting biopolitical strategy, wherein acceding to one’s properly gendered roles was made a condition for economic and political maturity for racialized populations. We explore how residues of colonial domesticity persist in the exceptionalism of the girl, yoking the performance of “proper” notions of modern girl and womanhood as conditions for social progress and economic development."
Behind the “racism” of the 2019 Hong Kong protests,"Scholars, intellectuals, and left-wing activists have recently come to reflect on the hostility and exclusion of Hong Kong protesters against mainland Chinese in the city’s democratic movement. This article is a response to the critical voice. Borrowing from Wing Sang Law’s (2008) conceptualization of colonial power as a network of relations, I argue that the power relationship between Hongkongers and mainlanders has been changing amid China’s rapid economic growth and extending cultural influence. The Hong Kong identity is no longer necessarily privileged over the mainland one. Individual mainland Chinese are not entirely neutral apolitical subjects, but inevitably placed in the grids of the power network of Chinese colonialism over Hong Kong. As such, the relevant questions for a truly liberating prospect for the movement concern to what extent and in what ways we can effectively differentiate “Chinese” from “China” in present Hong Kong amid evolving coloniality."
"The Contradictions of Conservation: Fighting Erosion in Mao-Era China, 1953–66","AbstractBased on local archival documents and fieldwork conducted in Shaanxi Province’s Baishui County, this article examines how large-scale water and soil conservation campaigns launched in Northwest China’s Loess Plateau region during the Mao era (1949–76) affected agrarian environments and how rural communities experienced and responded to these transformations. By mobilizing rural communities to combat water and soil loss, China’s leaders expected conservation to limit sedimentation along the Yellow River’s lower reaches and increase agricultural yields to support their vigorous program of industrialization. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, local opposition to these efforts to alter human interactions with the land centered on contradictions between the long-term objectives of conservation campaigns and the priority that the rural populace placed on ensuring subsistence. With residents called on to attend to conservation work instead of other production activities, divergent imperatives translated into intense competition over how to use the land and allocate labor power. Even if conservation programs in Baishui, as in other parts of China, drew on lay knowledge and practice, these environmental management policies consistently privileged the state’s developmentalist agenda over the welfare of rural communities. In this manner, Mao-era water and soil conservation supported, and was inseparable from, an extractive political economy that intensified contradictions between the rural and urban, agriculture and industry. Rather than giving voice to vulnerable populations and equitably distributing costs and benefits, Mao-era water and soil conservation exacerbated the burdens placed on marginalized rural communities."
On Intimate Reaches of US Empire: Neoliberal Imperialism and Domestic Abuse in Metro Manila,"Research shows that political economy—the structural distribution of a society’s economic resources as shaped by power inequalities—is linked to the incidence of domestic abuse as well as survivors’ success in escaping abusive relationships. Yet studies often overlook the extent to which domestic abuse in the global South is embedded in neocolonial structural violence. Drawing on interviews and surveys with urban poor women in Metro Manila, I explore how structural adjustment and state violence from the 1980s to the 2000s have inextricably shaped experiences of domestic abuse. Popular discourse and some gender scholars portray economic globalization as an empowering, even liberatory force for poor women in the global South. Instead, I trace how a political economy marked by what I call “neoliberal imperialism” has fueled domestic violence, not by boosting the upward economic mobility of urban poor Filipinas but by worsening their gendered precarity. I complicate feminist scholarship that has framed increased abuse as a male backlash against heightened female mobility. Gendered material inequalities, austerity, and militarization have serially exposed women and girls to cycles of violence. These facets of a neocolonial political economy collude to reinforce low-income Filipinas’ primary responsibility for reproductive labor, trapping them in abusive relationships despite access to cash earnings. I argue that imperialist extraction not only exacerbates domestic abuse but that interpersonal gendered violence is a tool for harnessing Filipina reproductive labor to reproduce empire. I critique carceral feminist responses to abuse in a neocolonial context, considering how urban poor Filipinas’ oppositional consciousnesses gesture toward structural alternatives."
Reproductive Health Care from Fascism to Forza Nuova,"This article examines pronatalism from Fascism to Forza Nuova to investigate how far-right political groups in Italy have historically approached reproductive health care. Visual analysis of posters and films read in context with the urbanism of Roman streets and rationalist obstetric clinics clarifies the specific strategies these groups have used to discredit female health-care practitioners and the broader reproductive choices they have traditionally provided to women. At stake in these artistic antecedents are the constellation of far-right causes and religious concerns that anchor and inform the current call for what I term the “new pronatalism,” defined here as the promotion of higher birthrates among native Italians to buttress nationalist demographic might. Forza Nuova frames their bid for Italian women to birth more children as oppositional: “Births at historic lows/Italy needs children/not gay marriage and immigrants.” By tracing the development of far-right breastfeeding propaganda over time, we can better understand authoritarian bids for control over reproductive health care today."
Mass Digitization of Chinese Court Decisions: How to Use Text as Data in the Field of Chinese Law,"Since 2014, Chinese courts have placed tens of millions of court judgments online. We analyze the promise and pitfalls of using this new data source, highlighting takeaways for readers facing similar issues using other collections of legal texts. Drawing on 1,058,986 documents from Henan Province, we identify problems with missing data and call on scholars to treat variation in court disclosure rates as an urgent research question. We also outline strategies for learning from a corpus that is vast and incomplete. Using a topic model of administrative litigation in Henan, we complicate conventional wisdom that administrative lawsuits are an extension of contentious politics that give Chinese citizens an opportunity to challenge the state. Instead, we find a high prevalence of administrative cases that reflect an underlying dispute between two private parties, suggesting that administrative lawsuits are often an attempt to enlist help from the state in resolving an underlying civil dispute."
"Migrant Flows: Hydraulic Infrastructure, Agricultural Industrialization, and Environmental Change in Western Mexico, 1940–64","AbstractThis article explores the relationship between the growth of irrigation works, environmental change, and rural migration in western Mexico from 1940 to 1964. It begins by analyzing how Mexico’s expansion of hydraulic infrastructure facilitated the transfer of industrial agricultural technology through the US-based Rockefeller Foundation. US-sponsored technical assistance programs privileged irrigation- and input-intensive production, undermining traditional Mexican land tenure and agriculture regimes while industrializing and privatizing natural resources. These processes altered rural livelihoods and landscapes in western Mexico, intensifying migratory flows already amplified by the Bracero Program. By examining the origins of western Mexico’s deeply rooted culture of migration through an environmental and technical lens, this article reframes conventional socioeconomic and political understandings of Mexican migrancy, revealing the essential roles of the natural and built environments in the growth of a mass phenomenon that dominates US-Mexican relations today."
A Backstage Tour of the Palace of Culture,"One form of anxiety about culture has always been that it will work too well to separate the cultured from the uncultured and thereby to separate thinking from the rest of the things that human beings do. One remedy advanced in various cultures has been an expanded sense of expression. This concern is more implicitly than explicitly political, since it calls on bodies, numbers, spatial relations, tools, and machines as mute coparticipants in human thinking. It is thus “inhuman” or “transhuman,” with a genealogy going back to Heraclitus. Some episodes of that genealogy are retraced here."
Brexit as postindustrial critique,"Anthropologists and other commentators struggle to make sense of pre-COVID-19 political developments in the postindustrial Global North. Various narratives were created to explain these dramatic events and changes, deploying an armory of social science analysis. We could approach one of these worrying developments, Brexit, as a postindustrial phenomenon. To make this case, I will compare my ethnographic material from postindustrial German cities with my experience in North East England as a non-UK, EU citizen. Brexit is not just a delayed response to economic decline and insecurity, epitomized in the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent times of austerity. Rather, Brexit indicates that the former industrialized countries of the Global North have not yet redefined their political and economic organization. Further, they have not developed an idea of what life after the postindustrial crisis can look like. I show that anthropology can contribute to precisely this kind of future-thinking."
The Etnos Archipelago: Sergei M. Shirokogoroff and the Life History of a Controversial Anthropological Concept,"The concept of etnos—one of the more controversial anthropological concepts of the Cold War period—is contextualized by looking at its “life history” through the biography of one of its proponents. Sergei Mikhailovich Shirokogoroff was a Russian/Chinese anthropologist whose career transected Eurasia from Paris to Beijing via Saint Petersburg and the Siberian borderlands of the Russian Empire. His transnational biography and active correspondence shaped the unique spatial and intellectual configuration of a concept that became a cornerstone of both Soviet and Chinese ethnography. The theory of etnos turned out to be surprisingly stable, while circulating through various political and intellectual environments ranging from England, Germany, and China to Imperial, Soviet, and modern Russia. This case study presents a history of anthropology wherein networks and conversations originating in the Far East of Eurasia have had unexpected influences on the heartlands of anthropology."
Police Violence and Public Perceptions: An Experimental Study of How Information and Endorsements Affect Support for Law Enforcement,"Incidents of police violence can undermine trust in legal authorities. Whether such incidents have this effect will depend on how citizens evaluate victims, the police, and public officials. Citizens’ evaluations may be shaped by information about (1) a pattern of police violence and (2) government responses. We study citizens’ reactions to police violence by randomly assigning these two types of information in the context of the Stephon Clark shooting in Sacramento. We find that information influences levels of blame for and trust in the police, but the effects depend on citizens’ race and whether they live in the community where the violence occurred. In contrast, information does not alter citizens’ perceptions of local police officer organizations and, in turn, their willingness to follow police endorsements in elections. These results suggest a catch-22 whereby police violence can diminish the standing of police personnel, but favorable local opinion preserves their political influence."
The Amicus Game,"Despite increased scholarly attention toward analyzing the influence of amicus briefs on case outcomes, we lack a microfounded model for understanding what we observe. Our analysis remedies this gap, modeling a world in which potential filers can advocate for a particular ruling and may provide information to influence a judge’s decision. We show that the influence of an amicus brief depends on the interaction of the group’s bias and contextual factors. Specifically, while the influence of biased groups is sensitive to features of each case, such as the stakes of the issue, moderate group influence is relatively stable. Our findings are also relevant for empirical studies; they indicate that analyses of influence with observational data are likely undermined by a failure to account for strategic group behavior. Notably, analyzing only filed briefs will generate biased estimates of influence unless the researcher accounts for a group’s interest in each particular case."
The Concentration Camp as Site of Refuge: The Rise of the Refugee Camp and the Great War in the Middle East,"The refugee camp today has been naturalized as a product of failed international idealism and political expediency that serves as a timeless reminder of the plight of displaced peoples. This article explores the refugee camp’s origins as a product of a late Victorian imperial and military legacy and the contingencies of World War I. The use of the concentration camp as a tool to provide refuge and control displaced populations began during the war as a humanitarian measure. Part of a larger world of camps that interned civilians, prisoners of war, and refugees during World War I, the refugee camp in the Middle East existed at the crossroads of Allied military objectives and the Western-led humanitarian movement. In the wake of victory in the east, the army of occupation, aid workers, and local actors fashioned the concentration camp as a site of refuge as part of an emerging international order. American relief efforts led by Near East Relief and later the League of Nations have been well studied. Less understood is how and why Britain, due to the central role it played in combat operations and eventually in dividing up the Middle East with its French ally, guided and shaped norms and conditions for dealing with displaced peoples. Ultimately, the experience of total war shaped Allied war strategy regarding civilian populations during the humanitarian crisis that engulfed the east. It produced the refugee camp as an ostensibly temporary solution to what became for many a permanent problem of statelessness."
Jobs and Environmental Regulation,"Political debates about environmental regulation often center around the effect of policy on jobs. Opponents decry the “job-killing” Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and proponents point to “green jobs” as a positive policy outcome. Beyond the political debates, Congress requires the EPA to evaluate “potential losses or shifts of employment” that regulations under the Clean Air Act may cause. Yet there is a sharp disconnect between the political importance of the jobs question and the limited research on the job effects of policy and general skepticism in the academic literature about the importance of those job effects for the costs and benefits of environmental regulation.In this paper, we discuss how the existing research on jobs and environmental regulations often falls short in evaluating these questions and consider recent new work that has attempted to address these problems. We provide an intuitive discussion of key questions for how job effects should enter into economic analysis of regulations. And, using an economic model that incorporates labor market frictions, we evaluate a range of environmental regulations in both the short and long run to develop a set of key stylized facts related to jobs and environmental regulations and to identify the key questions that current models cannot yet answer well."
"Balance, Yoga, Neoliberalism","Balance is a socially valorized quality in the United States, and yoga a social practice widely claimed to provide it. In this article, I investigate the semiotic logics of this widespread quality and theorize its relationship to the social practice of yoga and to political projects of neoliberalism and second-wave feminism in the United States. Analyzing ethnographic interviews that I conducted with white female yoga instructors in New York City in the summer of 2016, I show that balance is invoked by speakers as a guide to repurpose chronotopically anchored models of yoga to their contemporary lives. Balance provides speakers a sense that the chronotopic contrasts in these models correspond and are compatible with one another. Identifying three linked semiotic relationships upon which balance’s logics rely—contrast, correspondence, and compatibility—I argue that speakers’ interpretation of these logics is mediated by their social positioning as middle-class white women within a neoliberal political economy in the United States."
"Housing God, Losing Ground: Protestant and Catholic Chronotopic Ideologies in Urban China","This article examines ideologies of chronotopic partibility at two state-affiliated churches in Hangzhou, one Protestant and one Catholic, that emerged in response to the politics of demolition and development. The presence of Christianity in the state imaginary of the modern cityscape has been challenged by urban renovation projects ranging from Zhejiang Province’s 2013–16 cross removal campaign to the construction, beginning in 2018, of a massive commercial complex on land partially expropriated from a Catholic church in Hangzhou. Protestants made sense of cross removals by organizing time, space, and personhood according to qualities associated with the home, separating warmth and sociality (renqingwei’r ) from the buildings in which they are experienced. Catholics protested the city government’s requisition of a part of their “house” by demanding in its place the renqing, or human feeling, mediated by money, that is God’s in perpetuity. Chronotopic partibility or time-space-personhood fracture is both a symptom of dispossession and an ideology that makes possible moral exchange between church and state."
Getting Conservatives and Liberals to Agree on the COVID-19 Threat,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, political ideology has been perhaps the strongest predictor of consumers’ perceptions of the coronavirus’s threat. This article demonstrates that differences between conservatives’ and liberals’ responses to COVID-19 are mitigated when people perceive the virus itself to have agency. We propose that conservatives are generally more sensitive to threats that are relatively high (vs. low) in agency. Consequently, we find that greater perceived agency of the coronavirus increases its perceived threat among conservatives but not liberals, and that this interaction is driven by differences in the tendency to attribute responsibility to agential entities. We also explore the effect of these malleable threat perceptions on downstream consequences related to the pandemic, including planned in-person consumption frequency. This research offers public health officials, policy makers, and firms insight into how to communicate more effectively about the pandemic and contributes theoretically to the literature on political ideology and threat sensitivity."
Co-teaching Botany and History: An Interdisciplinary Model for a More Inclusive Curriculum,"This essay offers numerous ideas on how to integrate science and history into classroom pedagogy in a way that acknowledges the contributions of women and other groups underrepresented in science by highlighting the cultural and political contexts in which science developed rather than by adding token individuals to a history of science still largely defined by the achievements of a few great men. It details how students in a General Education class co-taught by a botanist and a historian of science at the Evergreen State College not only gained skills in field botany and vegetation analysis but also became more informed about how modern scientific disciplines took shape. Recognizing that race, class, and gender have played a role in how science developed, the students’ understanding of the complicated legacy of scientific inquiry gave them tools to be more rigorous in their thinking about scientific practice. This interdisciplinary approach, so crucial in fostering inclusivity in scientific disciplines, also promoted a deeper engagement with historical inquiry."
"(Re)Birth of a Seal: Power and Pretense at San Nicola, Bari, ca. 1300","This study introduces and contextualizes the artistic patronage of Petrus de Angeriacus (d. 1313), the powerful yet controversial treasurer of the pilgrimage church of San Nicola in Bari, Italy. It begins by assessing the life and activities of the treasurer within the dramatic political, religious, and social setting of the Kingdom of Sicily during the reign of Charles II. It proceeds to evaluate Petrus’s commissions for San Nicola, four lost candlesticks described in inventories from 1326 and 1362. It then probes in detail a work intended to travel beyond San Nicola—a seal impression previously concealed within a protective sac—and reconstructs its genesis within European currents of art production. Both the seal and candlesticks are placed in conversation with Charles II’s political and artistic initiatives and contested endeavors to expand royal jurisdiction. Ultimately, the treasurer’s commissions materialize networks of authority that have not previously registered in our understanding of Bari or southern Italy around the year 1300."
Sound in the Papers: Musical Hermeneutics in the Age of the Feuilleton,"This article examines the intersection of feuilleton writing and musicology in early twentieth-century Germany. Starting from the contemporary concern that music lacked the capacity to express its meanings and that listeners in concert halls could not understand music without intermediaries, I trace the historical actors’ quest to resolve that problem by establishing “musical hermeneutics,” a method that applied older scholarly traditions of understanding texts empathetically to music. Rather than on the historical evolution of hermeneutical ideas, the essay focuses on the publishing contexts in which one of its main protagonists, the music historian, public intellectual, and feuilleton author Hermann Kretzschmar, worked to found what he saw as a new discipline. I argue that the practice of and discourse on journalism at the time importantly shaped the search for words about musical sounds—for a language in which cultural, political, and social assumptions could be used both to explain the listening experience and to educate the listeners. The language of the feuilleton offered tools to convey observations, interpretations, and instructions on understanding music to a wide audience, far beyond the academy. Although Kretzschmar failed to have this approach incorporated into the musicological curriculum, and hermeneutic methods were not accepted until the late twentieth century, the struggles surrounding hermeneutics in the fin-de-siècle German-speaking world illuminate the role of publishing contexts in generating knowledge on sound. They reveal a complex entanglement of journalism and the humanities at a time before the two fields split into demarcated territories of knowledge."
Present Tense 2020: An Iconology of the Epoch,"When is it a good time to think about time? The answer provided by this essay is that there is no time like the present, especially the crazy, tense present of the year 2020. In this year four distinct scales of temporality have collided in a prolonged period of crisis and uncertainty: (1) the onset of a global pandemic that devastated the world economy and killed over a million people, the worst public health disaster since the Spanish flu of 1918; (2) a political crisis featuring the rise of authoritarian governments around the world that threatened to overturn two centuries of efforts to secure stable representative democracies, centered in the rise of a would-be tyrant and demagogue in the US; (3) an explosive social movement centered in the endemic condition of systemic racism in the US; (4) a global environmental crisis that threatens the stability of the planetary ecological system as a sustainable habitat for thousands of species, including the human. Quarantined in monkish isolation by the pandemic, the author has engaged in a set of reflections on these convergent time scales. Instead of the classic (and unanswerable) philosophical question “What is time?” this essay reflects on the ways we picture time in metaphors, figures, personifications, and diagrams. In an anachronistic gathering of images of time from ancient and modern sources, the essay attempts to replace the ontology of time with an iconology that may provide some useful tools for finding our way through this epochal crisis."
"Preserving the Microbial Commons: Intersections of Ancient DNA, Cheese Making, and Bioprospecting","This article outlines an interdisciplinary research project emerging from biomolecular archaeology interested in the prehistoric spread of dairying in Mongolia, Europe, and the Near East. By comparing the microbes present in ancient and contemporary dairy products, the Heirloom Microbes project is in conversation with two of the most exciting fields of science to the general public: ancient DNA (aDNA)—which promises a new science of history through genomics—and microbiome research—which promises new treatments to some of the most mysterious ailments of industrialized populations. In this encounter the politics of life itself meets the politics of history itself, as I will show through a detailed ethnography of contemporary peasant dairying practices in Switzerland and a discussion of the microbial bioprospecting underway among hunter-gatherer groups like the Hadza of East Africa. Contrary to imaginations of revolutionary ruptures and “missing microbes” prevalent in ancient DNA and microbiome research, I argue for the continuous reproduction of human-microbe relations in millions of multispecies peasant fermentation collectives in most of the world. These microbial commons have to be protected from attempts of patenting and commodification through the collective efforts of scientists and small-scale producers."
Ripping Up Ancestries: Indigeneity and Genealogy in Book 2 of The Faerie Queene,"Spenserians have long recognized the imperial overtones in the Briton moniments sequence at Alma’s Castle in book 2 of The Faerie Queene, in which the frantic narrative pauses to allow the hero knights Arthur and Guyon a bout of national history reading in the dusty archive of Eumnestes (“Good Memory”). But critics have overlooked the link between Arthur’s reading of that dynastic history and his very next act, a fight with the horde of primitive “villeins” besieging the fortress. Examining the two episodes as a diptych, I show how the scene of combat allegorizes the historical progression out of primitivism—the very theory of civilizational difference that informs the vision of genealogical development away from mere indigeneity in the Moniments. This vision had profound biographical and political significance for a poet tasked with “planting” Ireland. The fight narrativizes English colonists’ struggle, and frequent failure, to transcend the memory of their own erstwhile primitivism as chronicled in the Moniments and as manifested in the atavistic “villeins.” To read the events together, then, is to comprehend the intimate connections between Spenser’s antiquarian and colonial interests as embodied in his epic."
"Taxonomy, Race Science, and Mexican Maize","This essay explores the intersection of race science and plant taxonomy in the creation of evolutionary taxonomies (phylogenies) of populations of Zea mays, also known as maize or corn. Following recent work in the history and sociology of race, it analyzes maize taxonomy as technology. Through an analysis of successive attempts to classify diverse maize varieties, especially those originating in Mexico, it shows that taxonomy created possibilities for researchers to intervene in commercial agriculture, state development projects, biological conservation, and domestic and international politics and policy. It further underscores that the modern science of maize taxonomy was distinct but never inseparable from assessments of maize’s human cultivators. Attending to particularities of this relationship is crucial, because it reveals the application of maize taxonomy as a technology for ordering human diversity and intervening in human lives, as well as managing the impressive diversity of Zea mays."
The Tree Snail Manifesto,"Focused on the lives and deaths of Pacific Island tree snails, the crafting of apparatuses and practices for their study in laboratory and field, and the diverse people engaged in the work, this double-voiced essay by two long-term friends and colleagues joins science, politics, and culture to contribute to multispecies environmental justice and island biopolitical geography. In part 1 Hadfield tracks his own trajectory, beginning with professional life as a “pure scientist,” fascinated by patterns of development of marine animals, and then finding that fascination moving to efforts to stop the extinctions of native Hawaiian land snails, conservation efforts across the Pacific, and ultimately teaching and practicing resistance to political suppression of science and military takeover and destruction of islands around the world. In the idioms of science studies and anthropology, part 2 by Donna Haraway plays cat’s cradle games with Hadfield’s land-and-sea EcologicalEvolutionaryDevelopmental biology and activism. Haraway explores the complexity of practices crucial to life-altering scientific caring in the patchy Anthropocene. Parts 1 and 2 are linked by Satoru Abe’s print Parting Trees B, which is a vital hinge for collaborations in the Tree Snail Manifesto."
Are the Stars Aligned? Matchmaking and Astrology in Early Modern Italy,"This essay examines how early moderns used birth horoscopes (genitures) to assess the compatibility of prospective spouses before marriage. Astrologers could probe the horoscope of an individual to investigate his or her present and future physical and moral qualities or compare charts to reveal the personal compatibility of a couple and help establish the best time to consummate their marriage. These practices aimed at ensuring a fruitful marriage and the harmony and happiness of the couple and their families. Focusing on a few key examples, the essay outlines both the astrological theories and the social politics that propelled astrological matching, suggesting that its appeal lay in the promise of informed choice while also preserving free will. Finally, the author suggests ways in which astrological practices and the use of vast amounts of astronomical data share affinities with data-driven matching in our own time."
The Use of Regression Statistics to Analyze Imperfect Pricing Policies,"Corrective taxes can solve many market failures, but actual policies frequently deviate from the theoretical ideal because of administrative or political constraints. We present a method to quantify the efficiency costs of constraints on externality-correcting policies or, more generally, the costs of imperfect pricing, using simple regression statistics. Under certain conditions, the R2 and the sum of squared residuals from a regression of true externalities on policy variables measure relative welfare gains from policies. We illustrate via four empirical applications: random mismeasurement of externalities, imperfect electricity pricing, heterogeneity in the longevity of energy-consuming durable goods, and imperfect spatial policy differentiation."
Designing and Evaluating a U.S. Carbon Tax Adjustment Mechanism to Reduce Emissions Uncertainty,"There is increasing political interest in the United States in an economy-wide carbon           tax. However, many environmental groups see the emissions uncertainty under a carbon tax           as a significant shortcoming, leaving them reluctant to support carbon taxes without some           assurance about emissions outcomes. This has created an interest in options for reducing a           carbon tax’s inherent emissions uncertainty. One leading approach is a tax adjustment           mechanism (TAM), which automatically adjusts the carbon tax rate based on the level of           actual emissions relative to a legislated target. This article examines the role for TAMs           in carbon tax design and the trade-offs of alternative designs. Using two recent TAM           proposals (in former U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo’s [R-FL] MARKET CHOICE Act and for           the Climate Leadership Council’s Carbon Dividends Plan), we show that TAMs can           substantially reduce emissions uncertainty. We then show how different design choices           affect expected costs and emissions outcomes. We show that most design features have clear           trade-offs, improving some outcomes while worsening others. Thus the optimal design will           depend on the specific goals of the TAM."
Exit or Invest: Segregation Increases Investment in Public Schools,"Recent literature suggests that integrated communities invest more in public goods by overcoming political polarization that plagues segregated cities. However, investment in public education is not likely to follow the same pattern as other public goods because of the historical legacy with segregation and public education. To test this, I have collected data on the 11,000 plus school districts in the United States from 1995 to 2011. Using multilevel models with a state-school district nested design, I find that White-Black segregation leads to more investment in public education while White-Hispanic segregation, as well as segregation by income, has no effect. To help establish causality, I use the overturning of court desegregation orders as an exogenous shock to school segregation as a natural experiment. This result is robust across a broad array of alternative specifications. The results imply that segregation is still shaping public education."
Reading Tudor Folly: Sex and Scatology in John Heywood’s Play of the Wether,"Critics have long recognized the capacity of the Tudor interlude to present its largely aristocratic audiences with political counsel. John Heywood’s Play of the Wether (ca. 1533) is an example of the instructive potential of the form, its didacticism writ large in a narrative affirming the value of impartial princely mediation. Yet it can be difficult to reconcile this deliverance of counsel with the bawdy humor of the interlude; jokes charged with sexual and scatological themes distract from the main plot with dangerous references to Henry VIII’s personal life. Through considering ideas about the function of folly emergent from Heywood’s earlier interlude, Wytty and Witless (ca. 1525–33), this essay presents a complicity between carnivalesque themes and the core didactic function of the interlude. It concludes that the play’s sexual and scatological humor is foundational to invoking self-knowledge—an epistemic state prized by humanist civic ideals—and thus serves a subtler pedagogic end than often supposed."
"Elizabeth and Her Favorites: Britomart, Florimell, and Oram’s Concept of Fragmented Historical Persons","Attempts to identify figures in The Faerie Queene with men and women in Elizabeth’s court have proved problematic. In his work on Timias and Belphoebe as figures for Ralegh and the queen, William Oram provides a model in which Spenser explores psychological, moral, or political issues that interested him by fragmenting historical persons into more than one character. This article explores such fragmentation of Elizabeth into Britomart, Florimell, and her evil twin, the Snowy Florimell, extending Oram’s work on Timias to include Leicester, Hatton, and Essex. In the tournaments of Satyrane and Marinell, Spenser’s allegory explores the dangers of arousing and frustrating erotic desire, arguing that Elizabeth’s use of courtly and Petrarchan love as a way to enjoy intimacy without sex led to betrayal and danger to the state."
"Christopher Marlowe, Literary History, and the Lyrical Style of Blank Verse","This essay contextualizes the versification of Christopher Marlowe’s Tamburlaine among sixteenth-century efforts to reform English vernacular verse on the model of Latin unrhymed quantitative meter. Literary histories of unrhymed verse in the poetic and rhetorical theory of Roger Ascham, Gabriel Harvey, and others align the disappearance of unrhymed meter with the fall of civilizations and propose a return to classical metrics as a means of transferring the cultural and political authority of ancient Rome to Tudor England. Marlowe, however, offers in Tamburlaine an alternative literary history of unrhymed poetry through the formal affordances of blank verse. As an open form, blank verse lends itself to expansive speeches that, in the mouth of Tamburlaine, can paradoxically both produce action and arrest time. The form of blank verse thus resists the imperial teleology of its origins in the classicizing projects of the Tudor humanists. [C.M.]"
Prometheus Luomenos,"Percy Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound (1819) acknowledges “a certain arbitrary discretion” in its subject, turning from the extant play of Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound (Prometheus desmotes), to a form of creative translation of Aeschylus’s fragmentary, lost play about liberational unbinding, Prometheus luomenos. Possible translations of luomenos include not only unbinding and ransom, but—across the verb’s active, passive, and middle senses—to loosen, free, release, dissolve, destroy, annul, unknit. What could it mean to read Prometheus Unbound as a materially imaginative revision of the richly layered linguistic act of that drama, “the Luomenos”? This field of meanings exceeds liberation, and its provocation helps us account for the fully distributed play of unbinding for this drama, in which the unshackling of Prometheus by Hercules is a brief and perfunctory action. This essay argues that Prometheus Unbound does not idealize but undercuts both the meaning and desirability of the reigning liberal concept of freedom, using close philology and critical theory to investigate multiple registers of Shelley’s poetics of creatively bound freedoms: ecological, political, psychological, and erotic. Recalling that Prometheus is a trickster figure in classical myth—an aspect notably missing from the nominal hero of Shelley’s drama—I argue the trickster role moves from character to language. Epimetheus his brother is a figure of afterthought and retrojection, retroactivity, thinking after the event. I end by considering the coimplicating bonds and cuts in Saussure’s two-wave diagram from Course in General Linguistics (1916)."
Reading Feminism in Modern Tapestry’s Archive,"This article argues that modern tapestry’s archive reveals two lacunae in the history of modernism and addresses them through the dual practices of a feminist reading of the archives and an archival reading of feminism. The first lacuna is the role of women as not only artists but also producers of art, more broadly conceived. A feminist reading of the archive shows how women worked as “publishers,” weavers, widows, dealers, curators, and critics to produce tapestry and other forms of modern art. The second lacuna regards the role of the feminist art movement in transforming art history narratives, as feminists both recovered marginalized artistic practices and marginalized others that did not fit their political agenda. An archival reading of feminism shows how modern tapestry, as a relatively prestigious and masculine form of decorative art, would have complicated feminists’ simplification of modernism as misogynously opposed to decoration."
Constructing the Reproductive Behavior of Poor People: Regulating Procreation by Public Aid Recipients from Malthus to Murray,"This article examines the influence of dominant thinkers, social welfare leaders, and popular authors who asserted that public aid stimulates recipients’ biological reproduction. This idea was first systematized by political economist Thomas Robert Malthus during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, most notably in his famous Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthusian ideas on public aid and reproduction then influenced policy in the United States in the late nineteenth century. The ideas also provided a rationale for attacks on public aid programs in the mid-twentieth century and throughout the era of so-called welfare reform, typified by policies such as the family cap and other provisions initiated to regulate welfare recipients’ reproduction. These measures were influenced substantially by the work of political scientist Charles Murray. After presenting this history, the article explores implications of these ideas for current and future policy."
Feminisms in the Air,"COVID-19 both is and isn’t the name of a virus; it is many histories, many bodies, many politics. It is also the name of differential bodily burdens, differential state resourcing, and differential state securitizations under terms that create bifurcations between care and murder. One of the core contributions of a feminist analysis has been the examination of what was often an implicitly racialized gendering of a purported division between public and private; I examine its relevance to the multiplicities of COVID-19."
Environmental History in the 1960s? An Unsuccessful Research Application and the Circulation of Environmental Knowledge,"This article explores how the Swedish historian Birgitta Odén (1921–2016) sought to launch an interdisciplinary environmental research program in the late 1960s. Odén’s objective was to make history useful for political decision making, yet the research program never received any substantial funding. This article argues that the analytical concept of circulation of knowledge offers a fruitful way to revisit and contextualize this kind of failed or abandoned knowledge. Based on Birgitta Odén’s bequeathed papers and interviews with her former students, the study covers the years 1967 to 1969, and demonstrates how Oden conceived of environmental history in a period were no such field existed internationally. Moreover, the study illustrates how the humanities was connected to the social sciences, the sciences, the military research complex, and leading politicians in Sweden during the late 1960s."
Engineering the Rule of Law in Ancient Athens,"Scholars typically regard the rule of law—a stable and predictable process by which laws are implemented, enforced, and changed—as a cornerstone of good governance and a key factor supporting economic growth. Yet establishing the rule of law involves a trade-off: ex ante commitment becomes more credible, but ex post adjustments in response to new information become more costly. An understanding of this trade-off helps to explain the design of legal institutions in what was perhaps the first rule-of-law state: ancient Athens.No art whatsoever can make a rule that will last for all time. … But the law is always striving to make one—like an obstinate and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary to his appointment, or any question to be asked—not even in sudden changes of circumstances, when something happens to be better than what he commanded. (Plato, Statesman iii.579)Rightly constituted laws should be the final sovereign; and personal rule, whether it be exercised by a single person or a body of persons, should be sovereign only in those matters on which law is unable, owing to the difficulty of framing general rules for all contingencies, to make an exact pronouncement. (Aristotle, Politics 3.1282b)"
Authenticity and Anthropophagy in Kayapó Film Production,"Over the past three decades, films made by the Mebêngôkre-Kayapó people of Brazil have shown a distinctive and remarkably stable cinematic aesthetic, manifest in a set of filming, framing, and editing conventions first documented by Terence Turner. These films diverge significantly from Indigenous film productions documented elsewhere in Latin America, which tend to borrow more heavily from commercial cinematic codes and film genres. This contrast raises important issues about the personal, social, cultural, and political motivations behind such aesthetic and genre choices among different Indigenous peoples while posing the more fundamental question as to what exactly makes Indigenous media “Indigenous.” In this article, we describe what we identify as a Kayapó film aesthetic and discuss reasons for its continuity over time. We also consider the influence of hybridity, widely discussed by Indigenous media scholars elsewhere, but turn instead to the notion of anthropophagy as a more powerful root metaphor for understanding Kayapó film production. Although anthropophagy as an actual cultural practice and cosmological metaphor is generally associated with Tupi-speaking peoples of Brazil, culturally and linguistically distinctive from the Kayapó, the concept as applied by scholars of subaltern cultural productions helps us better understand the maintenance of Indigenous authenticity in Kayapó film production as the group navigates technological and sociocultural transformations."
"The Communist Party-Dominated Governance Model of China: Legitimacy, Accountability, and Meritocracy","As the single ruling party, the Communist Party plays an essential role in public administration and policy making in China. Under general secretary Xi Jinping’s program of “modernizing the governance system and governing capability” of the party since November 2013, administrative power is migrating from the government to the party. The party bureaucracy is interlaced with the state bureaucracy to produce a rare model of governance, which in turn has created many conceptual and theoretical issues for the study of good governance. This article analyzes China’s party-dominated governance model. Key issues of legitimacy, accountability, and meritocracy are discussed in an effort to delineate the advantages and problems of this model, analyze how it helps to shape the Chinese polity, and shed some light on good governance in general."
Allan Sekula: Photographic Work,"This essay examines the photographic output of Allan Sekula (1951–2013), focusing on the unrealized projects and abandoned works held in the collection of the Getty Research Institute. The artist’s archive spans the full spectrum of photographic work, including snapshots, test images, trials, uncompleted works, and unprinted images. Items also include Sekula’s notebooks, journals, correspondence, teaching notes, newspaper clippings, and photocopied texts. The archive is part of the fragmentary lifeworld of the artist in his studio, as it contains photographs that had been made and kept throughout Sekula’s life but were never incorporated into a complete sequence or finished work. The structure of his archive and the objects within it encourage us to consider not only Sekula’s vision of Los Angeles but also the greater social, political, and unconscious impulses that drive the making of images."
Theorizing Feminist Antirape Praxis and the Problem of Resistance,"Writing in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society in 2002, Carine Mardorossian argued that sexual violence had become a taboo subject in feminist theory. She lamented the lack of engagement of postmodern feminists with the issue of rape, leading to a turning away from “antirape politics” or its reduction to a “psychic dimension” in which “subjectivity” had become central. In this article, I revisit Mardorossian’s key claims, testing their veracity against some current critical and theoretical rape scholarship. Ultimately, I agree with Mardorrosian’s conclusion about the inadequacy of contemporary feminist theoretical work for grounding feminist antirape praxis, albeit for different reasons. In my argument, the failure of such scholarship to theorize sexual difference as critical not only to understanding rape culture but to what is required to oppose it leads to a circular logic that stymies a critical feminist praxis of resistance to rape. The prevention of and resistance to rape is not just about prohibitive laws that fix a particular iteration or account of what sex or desire looks like, nor is it about the reconstitution of women’s bodies as ready to fight off rape. Drawing on the work of Māori feminist scholars, I argue that feminist antirape scholarship must look beyond the act of rape as its point of departure for resistant praxis and instead orient itself around radical ontologies of sexuate being that offer an alternative to those through which rape culture currently proliferates."
"Milk Money: Race, Gender, and Breast Milk “Donation”","In 2014, the bioscience corporation Medolac Laboratories partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative, signing a Commitment to Action to increase breastfeeding rates among African American women. Medolac proposed to pay women in Detroit, Michigan, to donate their excess breast milk, arguing that women would breastfeed longer and earn enough money to delay reentry into the workforce. The program spurred resistance in the city of Detroit, where critics argued that it would exploit African American mothers without considering the historical and contemporary politics of breastfeeding and the commodification of black women’s reproductive labor. Through an analysis of the organization itself, and the resistance to the initiative in Detroit, this essay argues that Medolac’s proposed program reflects the continued exploitation of the reproductive labor of women of color in the United States and encourages an individualized, neoliberal focus on health at the expense of reproductive justice."
Thomas Tusser and the Poetics of the Plow,"This essay argues that Thomas Tusser’s popular book of georgic verse, Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, offered a counter to developments in courtly poetry under Elizabeth I. Critics have long disparaged Tusser’s poetry as naïvely rustic, but Tusser was not an uneducated peasant who happened to pick up enough literacy to pen a book of poems. On the contrary, Tusser was well-educated and deeply familiar with trends in Continental and English poetry. He studied under John Redford and Nicholas Udall, and he attended King’s College. He worked as a court musician before turning to farming and georgic verse. In his revisions of specific poems, appropriations of poetic forms, and his recollections of the mid-Tudor court, Tusser was responding to the fact that Elizabeth was not, as some had hoped, returning England to the heyday of popular commonwealth discourse that developed under Edward VI. The courtier-turned-farmer-poet was actively engaged in a poetic project to keep the populist aesthetics and politics of the mid-Tudor commonwealth alive. [S.O.]"
Let This Darkness Be a Bell Tower,Tony Chakar reflects on the cultural histories and political possibilities of abandoning hope in hopeless times.
Carbon Tax Review and Updating: Institutionalizing an Act-Learn-Act Approach to U.S. Climate Policy,"The design of climate change policy must address a number of key uncertainties, including           the impacts of climate change, the economics of a carbon tax, and the global effort to           combat climate change. A periodic review of each of these issues would provide new           information and analysis that could be used to reduce uncertainty and inform the updating           of a carbon tax over time. This article proposes and describes a straightforward and           predictable approach for reviewing and updating a U.S. carbon tax. Under this “structured           discretion” approach, the U.S. president would recommend an update to the carbon tax every           5 years, which would be based on government agency reviews of the environmental, economic,           and multilateral conditions related to climate change. Following a process that is modeled           after the expedited consideration of trade agreements, the U.S. Congress would agree to           vote on the recommended carbon tax update. This process could also be coordinated with the           timing of the emission mitigation pledging rounds under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.           I suggest that the institutionalization of such an act-learn-act approach to carbon tax           design could improve the political viability of a carbon tax and promote its adaptability           to changing environmental, economic, and multilateral conditions, which would likely           increase net social welfare over time."
The Slavery Business and the Making of “Race” in Britain and the Caribbean,"This paper discusses the work of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership project, which has focused on the significance of British slave owners between the mid-eighteenth century and the time of emancipation (1834) as a way of countering the erasure of the slavery business in popular memory. Slave owners were granted 20 million pounds in 1834 in compensation for the loss of “their property.” The documentation of this has made it possible to create a prosopography, and further research has been done on the economic, political, and cultural activities of those slave owners who were resident in Britain. Case studies of particular families can enrich this “big data.” The Long family is the focus of the second part of the paper. The activities of the three branches of the family, planters in Jamaica, merchants in London, and landowners in Suffolk, are sketched alongside a discussion of the different ways in which they contributed to “race making” in both metropole and colony. The hope is that such work can contribute to a changed understanding of Britain’s history and its relation to empire."
Meeting grounds: Art and anthropology in the Everglades,"This article considers issues raised while working at the intersection of anthropology and visual art in Everglades National Park and during the months that followed. Based on a May 2019 residency as an AIRIE (Artist in Residence in Everglades) fellow, the material expression of my efforts consists of volumes of visual fieldnotes and what I call anthro-artists’ books. For this article I take an intimate route, one that foregrounds the experience of being in a place and attempting work at disciplinary intersections. Set against a backdrop of theoretical issues in both anthropology and art as well as overarching social, cultural, ecological, and political concerns of the region, the resulting journals and handmade books are meant to create an emotional, emplaced, and bodily experience for the people who engage with them."
Packing the Courts: Ideological Proximity and Expansions to the Federal Judiciary from 1937 to 2012,"What explains expansions to the federal judiciary? Whereas existing research focuses on unified government as an explanation, we argue ideological proximity between institutions involved in the expansion process more accurately predicts judicial expansions. We examine whether Congress chose to add seats to each federal district or circuit court annually from 1937 to 2012 and find expansions are more likely when (1) the ideological distance between chambers of Congress is smaller and (2) the ideological distance between Congress and individual district or circuit courts is greater. These findings suggest the administration of federal courts is influenced by the political concerns in another branch of government, raising important questions about judicial independence."
The Great Interstate Divergence: Partisan Bureaucracies in the Contemporary United States,"Among American states, differences in welfare programs and civil rights protections are growing. Conventional explanations point to conservative organizations that score flashy legislative victories. We draw on case studies of Medicaid and election administration in Rhode Island and Kansas to show that much policy divergence is due to a banal and ideologically symmetric process of partisan administration. Most federal policies rely on state governments for implementation. In the cases studied here, agency workers turned to interstate networks of experts, advocates, and nonprofit workers that provide competing models of policy implementation that mirror party priorities: backdoor expansion of social services and voter registration in Rhode Island and introduction of market principles into Medicaid and restrictive registration practices in Kansas. Partisan administration makes state implementation of federal policy a key field of political struggle, on which administrators working beyond public view advance partisan priorities that often cannot be realized by other means."
The Most Expensive Slave in Rome: Quintus Lutatius Daphnis,"This article offers a detailed reconstruction of the life and career of Quintus Lutatius Daphnis (ca. mid-130s–ca. 80s or later BCE), who was born into servitude in Italy and twice sold for the highest price recorded in a Roman source (HS 700,000) before being manumitted. Daphnis’ education, upward mobility, and literary pursuits are used to reflect both on the luxury market for the highly educated (who were specially trained from a young age) and on the many roles such intellectuals played in the households of Rome’s political and social elite."
George Gascoigne’s “Patched Cote”: Writing Pedagogy and Poetic Style in the Literature Classroom,"This essay situates George Gascoigne’s literary career against humanist commentary on a stylistic error, “patchwork writing,” that emblematizes broader concerns about imitation, originality, transgression, and novelty. It argues that Gascoigne advocated a composition pedagogy rooted in choice, lenience, and attentiveness—and that studying his work can productively revitalize the writing pedagogy of the modern literature classroom. At the turbulent start to Gascoigne’s career, he was forced to patch over his poetry in response to charges of indecorousness. Despite his performative repentance, he would also betray resentment about how such discipline would stifle his creativity. He depicts this stifling in The Glasse of Governement (1575), a closet drama depicting a pair of prodigal sons failing to do their “tedious” homework and ultimately being executed by the state. Reading this tragic outcome against Gascoigne’s poetic principles, as articulated in his verses and in his guidebook, “Certayne Notes of Instruction,” reveals the text critiquing how rigid forms of composition pedagogy reflect political moribundity. The essay concludes by taking up Rebecca Moore Howard’s defense of students’ “patchwriting” as a first step toward reconsidering how a pedagogy rooted in choice might more centrally inform the role of writing in the early modern literature classroom. [A.N.D.]"
Jewish Emancipation Terminable and Interminable,"David Sorkin’s Jewish Emancipation: A History across Five Centuries is an imposing, textbook-like work of massive sweep. It argues that Jewish emancipation was simultaneously the most significant event of Jewish modernity and not an event at all, but rather a protracted, contradictory, and staggered process that unfolded differently in different regions over the course of time. On the surface, it simply narrates the political and legal changes in Jewish civil status in response to new rulers, revolutions, and wars. Underneath the surface, it makes normative claims about the precarity of liberalism and the Jewish place in the global liberal order."
A Call for Liberty: Rockwell Kent’s Puerto Rico Mural,"In 1937, the United States Section of Fine Arts unveiled two murals by Rockwell Kent in the US Post Office Department headquarters in Washington, DC. Depicting the farthest points served by the postal service, the murals were intended by the Section to present a unified vision of the country. But Kent, in collaboration with reporter Ruby A. Black and ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, inserted a political statement into one of the paintings encouraging Puerto Ricans to throw off the yoke of US rule. Based on unpublished correspondence between Kent, Black, and Stefansson, I argue that Kent’s message of universal democracy collided with his commitment to cultural nationalism and with the nationalistic nature of Section commissions. The incident resonates with controversies around US government-sponsored art projects that continue to this day."
Libertas and Freedom from Financial Burdens in the Reigns of Trajan and Hadrian,"The significance of Libertas, the personification of the concept of                         libertas (liberty), on the Roman imperial coinage is                     typically interpreted as a retort to a maligned predecessor and as communicating                     a more constitutional mode of governance that includes cooperation with the                     senate (libertas senatoria). Indeed, Libertas often appears on                     the coinage when there is much contemporary political rhetoric about                         libertas in the immediate aftermath of the death of an                     emperor deemed to have been a tyrant, such as Caligula, Nero, and Domitian.                     Nonetheless, literary texts suggest that libertas need not                     refer exclusively to political freedoms or freedom from tyranny but could also                     be used in the context of freedom from financial burdens, especially taxes.                     Legends on some coins of Caligula and Galba explicitly connect the Libertas                     personification with freedom from taxes and customs duties. Libertas appears on                     the coins of Trajan and Hadrian, neither of whom succeeded maligned                     predecessors, and, as she does so only in specific years after their principates                     had commenced, her appearance may be linked with certain historical events. The                     presence of Libertas on the coinage of these emperors coincided with the                     forgiveness of tax debts and other coins marking the alimenta                     program, which provided financial support for the upbringing and feeding of the                     children of Italy."
"A Cautionary Tale of Environmental Management: Malaria, Water Management, and Land Reclamation in Twentieth-Century Guatemala","AbstractIn the late 1920s, Guatemala embarked on environmental drainage projects aimed at eradicating mosquito breeding grounds. Designed to improve people’s lives, these efforts sometimes inadvertently undermined them, draining away water crucial to public hygiene campaigns. Although the goals of controlling malaria and expanding arable land were often in lockstep, the Guatemalan case of Lake Quinizilapa requires a more nuanced analysis. Bringing the historiographies of the environment and public health and medicine to bear on environmental management projects, this article demonstrates that environmental management and scientific medicine were as much about leveraging disease as eradicating it. Whereas Hispanic authorities could maintain theories disproven by entomology and parasitology without much criticism, indígenas (indigenous people) who articulated notions that contradicted science and challenged engineering’s supremacy were disparaged as ignorant inditos (little Indians). Intriguingly, the indigenous conception of the natural world more accurately predicted the outcome of the lake’s drainage prior to World War II. Political power and ethnicity determined the legitimacy of perspectives about the environment and disease."
Witnessing environments,"This article offers a conceptual and historical introduction to the significance of witnessing in relationship to environmental questions for the Hau special section “Witnessing Environments.” The articles in this special section take as their focus the often fragmented ways in which witnessing gains traction—as both practice and ethos—across environmental interventions. They also chart the ways that the pairing of “witnessing” and “environment” reconfigures both terms, with environmental questions, their politics, and their mediatization at once challenging and providing emergent spaces of creativity and experiment in relation to witnessing."
Nutritional Modernity: The German Case,"Germans were instrumental in shaping “nutritional modernity,” an era stretching from the 1840s to the present, in which nutrition became a vibrant field of scientific study as well as a preeminent tool of social control. Nutrition emerged as a scientific discipline in German laboratories and statistical studies in the nineteenth century. Responding to recurrent bouts of food insecurity associated with key moments of national crisis, moreover, German scientists turned hunger into a major social problem whose best solution lay in their hands. The article begins by considering major nineteenth-century contributions to nutrition science, from Carl Voit’s intake-output method to Max Rubner’s caloric vision of the human body. Second, the article investigates the development of nutrition as a scientific discipline against the backdrop of recurrent cycles of nutritional insecurity. Fear over the political threat posed by a hungry proletariat at the fin-de-siècle turned nutrition into a labor problem and stimulated the emergence of Volksernährung, an applied branch of nutrition science that was nationalized when the country faced severe food shortages during the First World War. Finally, the article turns to scientists’ social action in important fields such as nutritional prescription and popularization, from their frequent appearance as endorsers of reformist cookbooks in the nineteenth century to their role in developing didactic visual materials and mass scientific spectacles for the state in the twentieth. German nutritional modernity in its scientific aspects emerged from the confluence of these three trends: the scientization of nutrition in the nineteenth century, the medicalization and nationalization of hunger at the fin-de-siècle, and a vibrant tradition of scientific popularization that began in the nineteenth century and continued well into the twentieth. The German case provides a particularly useful venue for exploring how the social and scientific aspects of nutrition became entangled with the project of national governance."
Theater and Dionysiac Cult on Samothrace and Its Peraia,"This article examines the material remains related to theater and the cult of Dionysos on the island of Samothrace and its peraia (the coastal zone opposite the island, between Maroneia and Ainos) in combination with the written sources. The study first assesses the overall extent of Dionysiac presence and particularly the existence of theaters and theater-related artifacts in the heart of Aegean Thrace during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Second, the article offers a fresh examination of select portable finds and the Hellenistic theater in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods in relation to the developments at the Samothracian Peraia. The argument is made that in addition to the widely diffused Dionysiac cult and the overall Macedonian expansion, a decisive factor for the development of theater in the area can be traced in the local histories and the competition between waning and rising political centers, and that the construction of the monumental theater on Samothrace was the result of the strong theater tradition on the opposite coast.1"
"The Earls of Hereford and Their Retinue: A Network of Architectural and Sculptural Patronage in Twelfth-Century England, ca. 1130–55","Miles of Gloucester, earl of Hereford (1141–43), and his son, Roger, earl of Hereford (1143–55), were two of the main participants in the civil war between King Stephen (1135–54) and his cousin, the empress Matilda. Previous assessments of the earls have focused on their political and military careers, and particularly their transgressions against the Church. A lesser known fact is that both men were significant patrons of ecclesiastical architecture and sculpture, and were responsible for founding or rebuilding a number of parish churches and chapels. Analysis of the extant twelfth-century architectural sculpture at these sites suggests that the earls sought to develop and propagate a certain repertoire of church decoration, while also looking to prestigious cathedral and abbey churches for inspiration. The earls commanded a sizable following of lesser magnates and secular lords, some of whom were responsible for founding or rebuilding their own parish churches and seigneurial chapels. Judging from the sculptural evidence, these retinue members emulated one another and their lords, the earls of Hereford. Altogether, these findings present an alternative cultural perspective on secular lordship in twelfth-century England."
Feature—Taking Stock of Catch Shares: Lessons from the Past and Directions for the Future,"With the widespread implementation of catch shares (i.e., rights-based fisheries management) at the end of the twentieth century, economists have begun to examine empirical evidence about their performance. Yet despite documented positive outcomes and predicted gains from wider adoption of this approach, catch shares face persistent political opposition and criticism in the noneconomics literature. The debate surrounding catch shares focuses on equity, industry consolidation, nonlocal ownership of quotas, employment, and other impacts on fishing communities, but the evidence on both sides has been largely anecdotal. To inform this debate, it is important for economists and other researchers to produce rigorous analyses that quantify the effects of catch shares on employment, the distribution of economic value in the harvest and processing sectors, and other indicators of community well-being. We assess catch shares to identify research needs and guide policymakers. Using examples from the experiences of the United States and Argentina with rights-based fisheries, we demonstrate that a key challenge for researchers and policymakers is accounting for multiple species, globalization of seafood markets, and climate change. We urge policymakers to consider these forces and their impacts, along with available empirical evidence, when evaluating fisheries management options that balance efficiency and equity goals."
United Front Work and Mechanisms of Countermobilization in Hong Kong,"This article examines the Hong Kong regime’s mechanisms of countermobilization as a reaction to and preemptive strike against dissent. It reveals how united front work historically rooted in Chinese Communist Party apparatuses has penetrated into Hong Kong. The PRC’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong government have established a hierarchical yet dispersed platform to combine repression with outsourced contention. Hong Kong’s regime demonstrates its resilience in how it and the Liaison Office’s united front apparatus recruit nonstate actors to constrain opposition from below through both carrots and sticks. More broadly, the article unpacks how the regime’s mechanisms of patronage, counterprotest, attrition, and stigmatization operate. While these regime repertoires have curtailed organized resistance during some periods, they have also eroded the regime’s legitimacy, exposing it to the re-eruption of protests. The article concludes by assessing how the pro-government united front alliance was utilized during the unprecedented summer of dissent in 2019 over a proposed extradition law."
Microbial Antagonism in the Trentino Alps: Negotiating Spacetimes and Ownership through the Production of Raw Milk Cheese in Alpine High Mountain Summer Pastures,"In this paper I analyze fermentation practices in the production of cheese in Alpine high mountain summer pastures and their connection to politics of space, heritage, and ownership in times of ecological, social, scientific, and economic transition. In the Trentino Alps, fermentation is a technology for enacting different spacetimes in that it is not only a technical act but is also connected to how people practice and give meaning to places. I will focus on how fermentation participates in the composition of different human, more-than-human, and microbial spacetimes, which I call “utopias,” “heterotopias,” and “atopias.” In these spacetimes, fermentation translates space into cheese through different logics: overlap, transduction, or abstraction. Discussing how fermentation is managed and perceived gives us the opportunity to reflect on who owns the Alps and leads to a debate on how to constitute sustainable and just futures. Fermentation plays a key role in scientific innovation as well as in social innovation as to how the Alps will be assigned value and ownership."
"Developing Guidance for Implementing Border Carbon Adjustments: Lessons, Cautions, and Research Needs from the Literature","Policymakers are often reluctant to implement strong carbon pricing for fear of                     disadvantaging domestic industries and offshoring emissions-intensive                     activities. Border carbon adjustment (BCA) would address such carbon leakage                     concerns by using trade measures to ensure that products from foreign producers                     facing lower (or no) carbon prices are on equal footing with domestically                     produced goods. Despite intuitive economic appeal, BCA requires numerous                     challenging regulatory choices, including its scope of applicability (i.e.,                     which policies, goods, sectors, countries), the methodology for assessing the                     carbon content of products, the type and price of the adjustment, scenarios                     requiring modification, and how the resulting revenues will be used. Each of                     these choices has economic and environmental implications that influence the                     effectiveness of the BCA, as well as nuanced technical, legal, and political                     consequences that must be considered. In particular, the design of any BCA must                     comport with international agreements governing trade and climate policy                     responsibilities. This article reviews the economic and legal literature on BCA,                     provides guidance for the design and implementation of BCAs, and identifies                     research priorities."
Building a Feminist Commons in the Time of COVID-19,"The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been structured around the idea that human connection and sociality are bad—they are dangerous. This essay suggests that, perhaps paradoxically, rather than isolating to stay healthy, people are forging new egalitarian forms of connection. I argue that COVID-19 has enhanced experiments in what I will call a “burgeoning feminist commons.” These foreground new, horizontal forms of sociality, and they build the grounds of resistance, refusing to separate the time of political organization from that of reproduction. I discuss three such experiments: masked mobs, friendly fridges, and pandemic pods. Each form of connection takes place at a different scale, from the global to the local to the intimate, each with its own affective dimensions. These forms of togetherness are about coexisting in ways that ensure everyone’s survival. As such, they abandon any hope of purity."

"Interest Groups, Litigation, and Agency Decisions: Evidence from the Endangered Species Act","Interest groups are known to influence regulatory activity. Action-forcing litigation, the most direct way in which groups can affect regulatory decision making, is particularly relevant for implementation of the Endangered Species Act. Environmental organizations have filed hundreds of lawsuits to compel listing and critical habitat designation for imperiled species. This paper uses a unique data set to examine the role of citizen litigation in ESA implementation. I analyze the direct impact of lawsuits filed on behalf of a species and the effects of lawsuits filed on behalf of other species to assess whether there are spillovers caused by resource allocation constraints created by litigation. Results suggest that citizen lawsuits have a positive impact on ESA implementation and that the magnitude of these effects is significant. There is no evidence of negative spillovers from litigation on behalf of other species."
Reclaiming the sublime: The (un)making of the people’s constitution in India,"The Currents section foregrounds the work of Indian scholars who examine the ramifications of state responses and counterresponses regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019. This amendment to the Constitution of India granted citizenship to persecuted minorities from three nearby countries—namely, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan—but not to those who were Muslim. The act brought into question not just the issue of barring certain refugees to the country but also the relationship of India’s minorities with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party that is at the helm of a Hindu right-wing wave. The contributions focus on the implications of the amendments and the protests against them for minority and/or Muslim identities through a combination of historical, autoethnographic, ethnographic, media, and theoretical perspectives in the midst of growing religio-political communalization in the subcontinent."
Struggling with Complicity: Anti-militarist Activism in Israel,"Most Jewish Israeli anti-militarist activists frame their critiques within the boundaries of explicit loyalty to Israeli society and allegiance to Zionism, a stance that contributes to their mainstream appeal. They often frame their dissent as an attempt to rescue Israeli society from military abuses, but in doing so are often unwittingly co-opted as “internal affairs” officers for the military, exposing misconduct but also strengthening the military’s claims to moral propriety. As a result, we see the persistent seepage of militarism and militarist values into anti-militarist activism. Thus, Jewish Israeli activists face a number of ethical and political dilemmas as a result of their “insider” position, including whether to abandon their activist practices or renounce their national allegiance."
"Education, the Public Sphere, and Neoliberalism: Libraries’ Contexts","The period covered by the publication of Library Quarterly (LQ) has been one characterized by the arc of three defining contexts. First, libraries have been inextricably tied to educational institutions in the modern era. Second, libraries developed within democratic societies and took on aspects of the public sphere (as did classrooms), even while public spheres were being transformed in the macro sense. Third, these two contextual conditions predominated for half of our period but led to a fundamental conservative rethinking of civil society institutions like schools and libraries: neoliberalism as a loose set of economic and market principles projected into schools, universities, and libraries, resulting in economic and political inequalities and an undermining of democratic and civil society institutions. These three contexts do not explain everything about libraries during LQ’s run of publication, but they situate a great deal of that history."
Introduction: Gender and the Rise of the Global Right,"In this special issue of Signs, the contributors address the complex and powerful relationship between gender and the rise of the global Right. This discussion demonstrates how, in transnational terms, the Right has become a significant player in gender politics. It resists the denaturalizing, deconstructive analysis of gender and sex in critical, feminist, and queer scholarship and directs its efforts toward reinstating dominant essentialized gender and sexual norms. These efforts are often coupled with assertions of racial, ethnic, or religious majoritarianism. There is no one formula in responding to this right-wing ideological creep, but one thing is certain: feminist and other progressive groups need to seriously engage with this phenomenon. The compilation of articles for this special issue is one such effort."
James Bell’s Narrative of Cecilia Vasa’s Journey to England: Travelogue as Encomium,"This essay examines James Bell’s narrative of the Swedish princess Cecilia Vasa’s journey to England in 1564–1565 with focus on the representation of Elizabeth I and Cecilia. The essay argues that the narrative is best understood as a travelogue whose rhetorical function is that of an encomium, celebrating first of all Elizabeth, but also Cecilia and the two women’s relationship. In doing this, the text partakes in contemporary constructions of Elizabeth as potent yet female ruler through its deployment of the so-called rhetoric of love and through its use of iconography that depicts Elizabeth as wise and legitimate ruler. By positing Cecilia as lover of Elizabeth, Bell extends the discourse of love to foreign royalty and a potential political ally; a special bond between the two is set up in ways that would have been accessible to contemporary readers more broadly but also through imagery that would have connected the two in ways open to a more select readership. While the relative status between Elizabeth and Cecilia is maintained throughout the travelogue, Bell celebrates the venture of the journey itself, and thus the meeting of the two women in a way that defines it as a diplomatic exchange with the specific purpose of furthering contact, dialogue, and goodwill between the two countries.

Humanity and Its Beneficiaries: Footing and Stance-Taking in an International Criminal Trial,"This article elucidates the role of metapragmatic devices like footing and stance-taking in trial hearings before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. It focuses on the case of Ahmad al Faqi al Mahdi, a Malian Islamist found guilty of the 2012 destruction of cultural heritage in Timbuktu. We examine how the prosecution and defense reflexively formulate the hearing as part of a wider text trajectory and how they align personae across participation frameworks by locating the current courtroom event into a wider dialogical field. A careful inspection of these metapragmatic devices reveals how trial participants navigate the multiple tensions facing this emergent, amalgamated form of criminal adjudication, which lacks a coercive apparatus of its own and still bears the traces of the political act of its institution."
We’ve never seen anything like it: Witnessing coral death and resurrection,"The last “global coral bleaching event” lasted three years (2014–2017), solidifying the plight of the world’s coral reefs as a defining problem of the Anthropocene. The catastrophe inspired countless media stories, becoming common knowledge in parts of the world far from any coastline. Despite the urgency of this latest discovery of coral mass mortality, it is likely that coral decline would never have become the widely recognized crisis that it is today without the visual witnessing technologies that made bleaching so sensationally obvious. And now some proposed solutions to the problem of coral decline, such as large-scale, privately funded coral reef restoration projects, have become reliant on such witnessing tools to mediate public relations and engage many forms of social support. This article presents examples from coral visualizations and materializations in The Bahamas and Indonesia in order to explore the highly uneven politics of witnessing coral life and death."
Buddhist Law beyond the Vinaya: Monastic Constitutions (katikāvatas) and Their Transformations in Colonial Sri Lanka,"This article urges scholars to look beyond the Vinaya Piṭaka when thinking about the regulation of Buddhist monastic life. It makes this case by examining an understudied genre of vernacular legal texts that has influenced the regulation of monks in Sri Lanka for more than a millennium. Monastic constitutions, or katikāvatas, affirm the Vinaya’s authority in principle, while functioning in practice as stand-alone administrative codes. Promulgated by kings and monastic leaders, these constitutions aim to bring unity, discipline, and organization to particular communities of monks by consolidating and updating monastic legal principles “in accordance with the times.” Despite their historical and contemporary importance, monastic constitutions have not been studied comprehensively beyond the eighteenth century. This article fills that gap, charting transformations in katikāvatas from the late 1700s to the early 1900s, a period that saw the end of Laṅkan monarchy and the spread of British colonial control. Following a review of existing scholarship, this article demonstrates that during the nineteenth century a new type of monastic constitution gained prominence, which I call group katikāvatas. Through analyzing group katikāvatas, this article not only provides new insights into the practical adaptation of monastic law in Sri Lankan history, it also calls attention to the importance of Buddhist law-making more generally as a strategic activity undertaken by monastic collectives and their patrons in order to enhance and protect their reputation, independence, and material interests in changing social and political contexts."
Development Derailed: Policy Uncertainty and Coordinated Investment,"We quantify the sensitivity of investments to policy uncertainty by drawing on the Northern Pacific’s massive land grant and the ensuing political battle that generated significant uncertainty to title from 1879 to 1894. Focusing on irrigation because of its high asset specificity, our analysis exploits the spatially exogenous extent of the grant to identify causal effects on investment, inclusive of spillovers to secure land because coordinated investment is generally necessary to capture the scale economies of irrigation. We find that the uncertainty significantly deterred and delayed irrigation investment in Montana, which lowered the state’s economic activity by up to 5 percent.Large numbers of settlers are occupying such [railroad grant] lands, and it is important to them to know whether they can receive their titles from the United States, or whether they will be required to purchase from the railroad companies. The prevailing uncertainty necessarily retards improvements and impairs values. (Noah C. McFarland, General Land Office Commissioner, US Department of the Interior 1882, p. 11)"
"Judicial Selection and Criminal Punishment: Trial Court Elections, Sentencing, and Incarceration in the States","This paper develops and tests a theory that in states with judicial elections, criminal justice outcomes will be more punitive than in states without elections. Leveraging a data set previously unused in the judicial politics literature, I estimate time-series regressions of state sentencing and incarceration rates over a 38-year period while distinguishing between types of judicial elections to establish support for the theory. I find that states where trial judges are reelected are generally more punitive than states without judicial elections, and this punitiveness is in response to the public’s ideological preferences, indicating that elections serve as an important judicial accountability mechanism for citizens."
The Pandemic Is a Portal,"In “The Pandemic Is a Portal,” second-year teachers in a graduate-level education program share the extraordinary challenges of teaching during COVID-19, exploring the broader social and political forces that have shaped teacher experience during these trying times. In these reflections teachers grapple with imposed policies and practices that they view as inequitable and hurting their students and call for more equitable schooling practices."
"Pigs and Pork in Denmark: Meaning Change, Ideology, and Traditional Foods","This article engages with contemporary meaning and meaning changes within the porcine semantic field in Denmark. More specifically, I argue that pork is acquiring the meaning of Danishness. Analytically, I focus on the relation between language usage in different settings and on how situational usage relates to nationwide, mediatized discourses. The porcine field lends itself readily to such analyses, as pork has been the center of much political and politicized attention over the past decade, and much of the discursive engagement with pork implies or expresses an ideological and moral stance. Interactional data come from field studies in a school, a fine-dining restaurant, and a fast-food restaurant. Media data are sampled from three relatively recent debates on Danish values."
Multiple Maternities: Performative Motherhood and Support Seeking in South Africa,"This article makes a case for a performative understanding of motherhood through an analysis of low-income women’s performances of motherhood in an inner-city neighborhood in Durban, South Africa. Drawing upon performativity theory, I track how women applied repertoires of speaking and acting to garner resources from a variety of persons and institutions. On a local level, these performances of motherhood have important political and economic stakes. In South Africa, 35 percent unemployment and historically low marriage rates have put once-reliable means of supporting children—employment, husbands, and husbands’ family—out of reach. Although women are expected to raise children properly, they are not regarded as legitimate recipients of aid in their own right. Children are considered the deserving beneficiaries. Thus, women can only access resources as maternal caregivers to needy children. At a theoretical level, it is critical that feminist scholars attend to the sociolinguistic resources used to perform adequate motherhood because the available repertoires of language and practice significantly influence how motherhood is experienced and understood. A performative analysis of motherhood offers a different vantage point on enduring discussions about power and agency and enables us to track how the categories of understanding and experience come about and work in the world. Data for this article are drawn from eighteen months of ethnographic and archival research with female caregivers, families, and aid agencies."
Wayfair in Constitutional Perspective: Who Sets the Ground Rules of US Fiscal Federalism?,"The 2018 US Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair is arguably the court’s most consequential state tax decision in a generation, perhaps longer. The Wayfair decision overturned the Supreme Court’s 1992 decision in Quill (itself a continuation of the Supreme Court’s ruling in National Bellas Hess a quarter century earlier), which had prohibited states from imposing a use tax collection obligation on vendors without a physical presence in the taxing state. Although the decision marks a welcome milestone in the development of the retail sales tax as an effective destination-based consumption tax, the court’s decision also invigorates the constitutional principle of state autonomy in fiscal matters, leaving the imposition of any constraints on state taxing power to Congress. However, unlike in earlier eras when Congress responded to court decisions with new statutory limits, today’s Congress faces historic polarization and legislative gridlock, reducing the likelihood of federal reforms designed to promote uniformity and simplification."
"Conflict, Educational Attainment, and Structural Transformation: La Violencia in Colombia","We examine the long-term impact of violence on educational attainment, with evidence from Colombia’s La Violencia, a period of intense political violence in the mid-twentieth century. We find that individuals exposed to violence during and especially before their schooling years experience a significant and economically meaningful decrease in years of schooling. Exploring consequences beyond human capital accumulation, we show that exposed cohorts also engage in economic sectors that typically employ less qualified labor and are less likely to transition to jobs in manufacturing and services (relative to agriculture). Violence thus appears to place obstacles in the process of transitioning to more modern sectors, potentially affecting the structural transformation that may occur as income increases."
Reflection: Conviviality and Companionship: Parrots and People in the African Forests,"AbstractThis article provides an account of how humans and parrots interacted in African tropical forests during the Holocene. Underscoring the growing intersections of environmental history with affiliate fields, it employs the insights of animal studies and the environmental humanities to suggest the term “conviviality” as a way of characterizing the heterogeneous assemblages that structured parrot-human politics. In doing so, it draws on ecological, ethnographic, historical, and ethological evidence to construct a more-than-human narrative of the past. Hampered by trypanosomiasis and tsetse flies from keeping livestock, people probably tended parrots as they did guinea fowl and chickens. However, human relationships with parrots were more affective than with poultry because of the parrots’ sociability and vocal abilities. Because people did not domesticate or frequently tame parrots, neither the term “companion species” nor Marcy Norton’s concept of “iegue” adequately describe the relationship between parrots and humans in African forest villages. The better description may be “proximate conviviality.”"
“Project Man in Space”: Applied Anthropology’s Cold War Space Oddity,"During the 1950s, partially in response to the Soviet Union’s launching of Sputnik, social psychologist Donald Michael launched Project Man in Space, a group of American social scientists organized to study and shape American attitudes toward space exploration. Margaret Mead and other anthropologists’ involvement in the Man in Space program is detailed here, and although the program is shown to have done valuable work measuring public understanding of space, the fact that the program focused on civilian space travel fantasies while downplaying the militarization of space indicates important political dimensions of this applied project."
The performative photograph: A poietic approach to visual ethnography in a French banlieue,"By reexamining the empirical relationship between ethnography and photography, this article explores the phenomenology of photographic experiences in a French banlieue. Photography may be a powerful practice to critically depict social phenomena in the field. Taking into account the basic assumption that photography is more than visual evidence of observed realities, I analyze the creative and nonindexical dimensions of visual experiences. Based on collaborative, sensorial, and pragmatic practices, I discuss the politics of visual representation in marginalized and racialized urban spaces from an intersectional point of view. The analysis developed here contributes to the definition of a creative and critically self-reflexive approach to the depiction of ethnographic experiences. In doing so, this article explores the plastic, poietic, and performative dimensions of photographic narratives in visual ethnography.Figure 1. (Author, 2017)"
The Pleasure of Hating the Renaissance,"This essay reads Ruskin’s The Stones of Venice through the lens of Erich Auerbach and Jacques Rancière to argue that the nineteenth-century term “Renaissance” names a link, never secure, between art, history, and collectivity—which is to say, a continual rebirth of historical life. Reading Ruskin makes clear that since the nineteenth century Renaissance has never meant, despite the efforts of many from a variety of political positions to make it mean, an abstract concept of beauty manifesting itself as the informing spirit of works of art. It has never meant a majestic subject standing athwart from history and imposing his masculine will upon yielding, feminine materials. It has never meant a Eurocentric imposition of universal values upon the peripheral world. Instead, a Renaissance by definition violates epistemes by insisting upon a link between disparate times, places, and peoples. Thus the term that demarcates the cinquecento as a unique historical moment also is the term that demarcates a nineteenth-century aesthetic."
Burden Sharing under the Paris Climate Agreement,"Two decades after creation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), parties reached a general political consensus in support of reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but debate continues over how to share equitably the burden of mitigation across countries. As part of the December 2015 Paris Agreement, countries submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for GHG mitigation. I analyze these mitigation targets to evaluate the degree to which they resemble any specific burden-sharing proposals. Results could have several applications as the UNFCCC process continues, including simulating how mitigation commitments may evolve as countries develop and considering how increased ambition might be allocated while maintaining the current implicit burden-sharing allocation."
Reimagining Gender: Gender Neutrality in the News,"Since the 1970s, the term gender neutral has risen to prominence in debates over issues ranging from pronouns to parenting to public restrooms. To advance understanding of this key term in recent gender politics, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of almost one thousand articles from four major newspapers—over a forty-year period—that mention the term gender neutral. The term arises in news articles discussing gender equality between women and men, lesbian and gay rights, and transgender rights. Those articles discussing gender equality between women and men, however, tend not to discuss LGBT rights. Likewise, those articles that discuss LGBT rights rarely discuss gender equality. Moreover, we identify three distinct ways of framing gender neutrality and show that they are differentially associated with reporting on gender equality between women and men, sexual orientation, or gender identity, respectively. By showing how these three frames represent distinct challenges to prevailing gender arrangements, this article advances theoretical understanding of undoing and redoing gender."
Introduction: The Changing Pedagogical Landscapes of History of Science and the “Two Cultures”,"This introduction to an Isis Focus section on pedagogy reflects on the changing institutional and political landscapes of the “two cultures” debate in education—both at the inception of the field of history of science and now. It discusses how pedagogical visions for our field have shaped and been shaped by relationships between the humanities and the sciences in colleges and universities, as well as by evolving scholarship in history education and the history of science education. It briefly reviews and connects the essays in this Focus section according to three themes: rehistoricizing history of science and science education; experimenting with history of science in General Education; and the benefits and challenges of interdisciplinary collaborations (especially collaborative co-teaching with scientists)."
Annihilating the “savage slot” from anthropology: Materializing reflexive practices,"Calls to “decolonize” the social sciences have reverberated in academia since at least the 1950s. Anthropology, in particular, has been marked as the “child of colonialism” and “handmaiden of imperialism” (Gough 1968). Over the course of eight decades now, critics have highlighted the unequal power structures which have framed ethnographic practices and anthropological knowledge production. Yet, anthropology’s “savage slot” (and its manifestation in newer iterations) along with its epistemological and political logic have yet to be dislodged, persisting in contemporary disciplinary practices. This short essay argues for the need to address this crucial gap between anthropological theory and disciplinary practices, to act urgently to acknowledge and then resoundingly reject the haunting legacy of anthropology’s “savage/primitive/native slot.” Given that decolonization is ultimately about dismantling global hierarchies, I suggest that this can only be achieved through materializing progressive and deeply reflexive practices in the work of doing, writing, and teaching ethnography."
The Teaching Professions and Globalization: A Scoping Review of the Anglophone Research Literature,"Based on a scoping review of anglophone, peer-reviewed studies published in the period 1990–2018, we analyze and discuss the research literature on teachers, teaching, and globalization. Distinguishing between three categories of globalization theories, centered on (i) culture, (ii) political economy, and (iii) flows and systems, we trace the uses of these theories in the literature over the period, as well as their associations with specific topics concerning teachers and teaching. We argue that the theoretical trajectories of these strands have come to emphasize certain topics, while neglecting other topics such as teachers’ labor markets, and call for further research into the theoretical trajectories dominating the field. Furthermore, our review highlights that a large part of the research in the field does not theorize globalization at all, leaving several issues concerning teachers and teaching undertheorized."
The American Founding as a Blended Scotch: A Reply to Thomas West,"One of the disputed questions about the American founding is whether its principles were derived from multiple sources (like a blended scotch) or from a single predominating tradition (like a single malt). In The Political Theory of the American Founding, Thomas West makes a strong case for the dominant influence of modern natural rights, yet he gives only a brief consideration of the “blended” or “amalgam” thesis that traces the founding to multiple traditions. I would like to challenge West and to reformulate the amalgam thesis by analyzing eight traditions that shaped the founding: English common law, Protestant Christianity, Roman republicanism, Enlightenment liberalism, aristocratic statesmanship, Madisonian republicanism, self-government in colonial assemblies, and Freemasonry. I argue that West’s approach is deficient because it cannot explain the complex characters of the American founders or their ideal of “ordered liberty.” Hence, equal weight should be given to the multiple sources of the American founding."
Spenser’s Golden Age Memories: Recollecting The Ruines of Time in Prothalamion,"This essay explores how Spenser’s late poem Prothalamion both reconstructs and deconstructs Golden Age myths of poetry and politics, through allusions to Ovid’s Metamorphoses and Fasti as well as through the intertextual presence of Spenser’s early complaint The Ruines of Time. Although Golden Age memories of a time before a fall into time connect these two poems, Spenser nevertheless reveals Prothalamion to be a retrospective fiction constructed from The Ruines of Time, an intertextuality reflective of Spenser’s career-long poetics of ruin and recollection. As I argue, Spenser’s poetics relate to the art of memory, as dramatized by its origin story: the tale of the poet Simonides, who discovers locational memory by recollecting a ruined edifice. By remembering Prothalamion from The Ruines of Time, Spenser both recollects and reforms the memorial ruins of his own past and poetry, while challenging the myth of the Golden Age associated with Queen Elizabeth and his presumed role as England’s new Virgil."
"Learning to See Climate Change: Children’s Perceptions of Environmental Transformation in Mongolia, Mexico, Arctic Alaska, and the United Kingdom","What are the factors that render environmental concerns salient in people’s lives, and under what conditions do people make connections between an abstract concept such as climate change and concrete experiences in their own daily circumstances? Taking as our focus ethnographic work with children in several different ethnographic settings (Barrow, Alaska; Oaxaca, Mexico; Tuv aimag and Uvurkhangai aimag, Mongolia; and East Anglia, United Kingdom), we explore how the children come to articulate environmental knowledge as a process of “figuring out” and the extent to which the children engage with the changing climate as a matter of concern. The paper provides an ethnographic account of the main themes that emerged in each region, before developing a comparative discussion of some key factors that gave shape to how climate change comes to matter in the lives of the children. Three dimensions are explored: the effect of climate change on livelihoods and the proximity of children’s experience to those livelihoods, the political salience of the narrative of climate change, and the temporal depth invoked by the environment."
What It Meant to Be Linnaean in Revolutionary France,"This essay builds on recent scholarship on Linnaeus to revise our understanding of how and why he became influential in France in the 1790s. It looks in particular at the nontaxonomic writings of Linnaeus (such as the Amoenitates Academicae) and the young men associated with two voluntary societies that emerged in Paris early in the Revolutionary decade—the Société d’Histoire Naturelle and the Société Philomatique—drawing on their minutes as well as the correspondence and other writings of their members. The essay focuses on Alexandre Brongniart (1770–1847), who was an active member of both societies, and the younger men he mentored, including Ernest Coquebert de Montbret (1780–1801) and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778–1841). It concludes that to be Linnaean in Revolutionary France was not simply to embrace Linnaean taxonomy and nomenclature; rather, it was to practice natural history as a form of citizenship validated by patriotic arguments for its utility to the nation that were based on Linnaeus’s theory of natural and political economy grounded in the land."
Important Factors in Midwestern Public Librarians’ Views on Intellectual Freedom and Collection Development: Part 1,"This research project examined the beliefs and actions of US midwestern librarians concerning intellectual freedom and collection development. The results are presented in two complementary articles; this first article provides some background and the results pertaining to intellectual freedom, whereas the second article will focus on the results for collection development questions and conclude with a broader discussion. The data were obtained through an extensive survey with a 21.37% response rate. In general, high levels of support for intellectual freedom were found across most respondents and across multiple questions. Respondents with an MLS degree were more likely to be in alignment with ALA stances and to support intellectual freedom. Despite anecdotal suggestions that the political leaning of a community may influence support for intellectual freedom, that was not found in this survey. Finally, nearly 40% of respondents indicated tension between their personal beliefs and professional stances with regard to intellectual freedom."
Judicial Choice among Cases for Certiorari,"How does the Supreme Court choose among cases to grant cert? In a model with a strategic Supreme Court, a continuum of rule-following lower courts, a set of potential cases for revision, and a distribution of future lower court cases, we show that the Court takes the case that will most significantly shape future lower court case outcomes in the direction that the Court prefers. That is, the Court grants cert to the case with maximum salience. If the Court is rather liberal (or conservative), then the most salient case is that which moves the discretionary range of the legal standard as far left (or right) as possible. But if the Court is moderate, then the most salient case will be a function of the skewedness of the distribution of ideologies of the lower courts and the likelihood that future cases will fall within the adjusted discretionary range. The extent of the political alignment of lower courts affects not only substantive lawmaking by the Supreme Court but also the earlier decision of whether to grant a given case cert to begin with."
Disfiguration and Desire: The Erotic Historiography of Hope Mirrlees’s Paris: A Poem,"This article reads Hope Mirrlees’s Paris: A Poem as an epic—that is, as “a poem including history” to use Pound’s formulation—that reconfigures the act of including history as a particularly erotic one. Through certain rhetorical figures such as metaphor and pun, Mirrlees stages the most urgent questions of her historical moment in terms of paradox: the drawing together of that which maintains an unresolvable difference. The imagination’s attempt to reach across an unbridgeable gap figures the restless reach of desire in the poem. This poetico-historical project has specific socio-political implications. Paradox’s force emerges from its ability to keep the mind in motion; Mirrlees wields this power to create an erotic historiography that resists consigning the events of the “just now” to the “stillness” of the past. In this way, Mirrlees’s poem offers neither a neat story of Paris’s history, nor an easily-consumed portrait of life in Paris in the spring of 1919. Rather, predicated on the rhetorical as opposed to the merely referential, Paris reveals that historical occurrences—including historical tropes of women—are always necessarily constructed figuratively, marking at once the limits of recording history and the poem’s means of (and grounds for) historical critique."
The Reinvention of an Appropriate Tradition or the Colonial Birth of Vietnamese Medicine,"This chapter examines the impact of colonialism on the “invention” of Vietnamese medicine (VM) in the first half of the twentieth century. It focuses more specifically on the legal framework dealing with VM in the interwar period, when Vietnamese nationalism was on the rise and French colonial authorities were assessing the “successes” and “failures” of the Assistance Médicale Indigène (AMI), the colonial health care system established in 1905. I argue that this invention was at the same time pragmatic, programmatic, and ideological; it aimed at “naturalizing” the AMI to adapt it to local medical needs within the imperial framework and French budgetary constraints. Bridging political, institutional, professional, and therapeutic spaces, this article brings into focus the process whereby VM was not only domesticated, but legally defined for the first time and given specific roles within the colonial health care system. Analysing the discourses framing VM as a “traditional,” “complementary,” and “natural” medicine, I explore the different meanings of science, toxicity, and tradition in this context, as well as the issue of accessibility to essential care. I emphasize the participation of the Vietnamese population, especially Vietnamese doctors and healers, in this process. In so doing, this article helps to reconsider the historiography of traditional medicine worldwide and underlines the importance of a postcolonial approach to a much-needed history of so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Last but not least, it highlights the impact of colonialism on the framing of a “national medicine” that would play a crucial role in post-1954 Vietnam medicalization and nation building."
Do Local Party Chairs Think Women and Minority Candidates Can Win? Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment,We conducted a national survey of local party chairs that included a conjoint experiment to assess the effects of candidates’ race and gender on chairs’ assessments of their likelihood of winning a state legislative primary election in their area. Chairs from both parties viewed women candidates as just as likely as men to win the support of their base but viewed Latinx and black candidates as substantially less likely to win. The disadvantage chairs believe minority candidates face is insensitive to variation in county demographics among Republican chairs but is attenuated among Democratic chairs serving counties with larger minority populations. Our findings suggest that officials from both parties believe that minority candidates face an uphill battle with their base. This perception may color chairs’ decisions about which candidates to recruit and most vigorously support.
"Patchy Anthropocene: Landscape Structure, Multispecies History, and the Retooling of Anthropology: An Introduction to Supplement 20","The Anthropocene deserves spatial as well as temporal analysis. “Patchy Anthropocene” is a conceptual tool for noticing landscape structure, with special attention to what we call “modular simplifications” and “feral proliferations.” This introduction suggests guidelines for thinking structurally about more-than-human social relations; “structure” here emerges from phenomenological attunements to specific multispecies histories, rather than being system characteristics. Indeed, we discuss “systems” as thought experiments, that is, imagined holisms that help make sense of structure. Ecological modeling, political economy, and alternative cosmologies are systems experiments that should rub up against each other in learning about the Anthropocene. We address the misleading claim that studies of nonhumans ignore social justice concerns as well as suggesting ways that ethnographers might address “hope” without rose-colored glasses. This introduction offers frames for appreciating the distinguished contributions to this supplement, and it traces key changes in anthropological thinking from the time of this supplement’s predecessor, the Wenner-Gren Foundation–sponsored 1956 volume, Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. Rather than interrogating philosophies of the Anthropocene, the supplement shows how anthropologists and allies, including historians, ecologists, and biologists, might best offer a critical description."
The ethnography of the global after globalization,"This collection of essays seeks to reinvigorate ethnographic investigation of the contemporary global. At a moment afflicted by transnational pandemic, political chauvinism, and disciplinary retrenchment, they offer a model for reengagement with the global. Critical work in anthropology over a decade ago was published when optimism over a “borderless world” still held sway. In the intervening years, globalization has bequeathed a world of viral contagion, authoritarian nationalism, immigration backlash, sclerotic trade regimes, and intensifying ecological crisis. Nonetheless, if the promise of globalization appears to have evaporated, global problems have redoubled in their importance for an engaged anthropology, as both the recent resurgence of nationalism and the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate. This collection of essays features research and reflection that address the global as a problem space through middle-range analysis. Inspired by the landmark work of Aihwa Ong, the essays embody a distinctive form of ethnographic engagement with the contemporary global."
The Ethics of Delegating Monetary Policy,"The global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 transformed monetary policy, forcing central bankers to move far beyond their pre-crisis instruments, goals, and expertise. In this article, I investigate these developments from a perspective of normative democratic theory. Against authors who reject central bank independence entirely, I argue that it should in principle be permissible for governments to delegate political choices to unelected experts. From a democratic perspective, what matters is whether the act of delegation serves the government’s ultimate economic policy aims. Although central bank independence limits the government’s control over monetary policy, it can also improve monetary policy and thereby help the government pursue its larger economic policies. I outline a moral framework for balancing these competing considerations; focusing on the case of the European Central Bank, I then argue for democratic reform of existing institutions."
Abrogation and assertion: The fault lines of the Indian Constitution with regards to Kashmir,"In this article I look at the responses of Indians to political events in 2019 regarding the abrogation of Article 370 concerning Kashmir in the Constitution of India and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The critiques of abrogation as well as of the CAA as put forth by the people of India were based on constitutional grounds, decrying them as inconsistent and in conflict with the basic principles and ambit of the Constitution. I juxtapose these responses with a critique of the Constitution and the sovereignty it offers to India through an engagement with Kashmiri Muslims in Delhi. The anti-CAA protests offered Kashmiris an opportunity to extend their solidarity with Indian Muslims as well as comment on the ambivalent nature of Indian secularism as it is pitched against minorities. However, Kashmiris also offered a structural critique and a rejection of the sovereignty of the Indian Constitution: for while it sanctioned equality and freedom for Indian citizens, it is the basis of oppression and occupation of their homeland."
Decentralizing the Origin of Civilization: Early Archaeological Efforts in China,"In the early 1920s, J. G. Andersson discovered the Yangshao culture of prehistoric China and, in the name of science, reiterated the age-old postulation that “Chinese culture had a ‘Western’ origin.” In Andersson’s time, archaeology was frequently explained using the framework of diffusionism to understand human prehistory and civilization. To the hyperdiffusionists, civilization was perceived to have originated in the Middle East before it spread elsewhere and acquired regional variations. The archaeological work at Anyang from 1928 onward substantially changed scholars’ understanding of human civilization in general and Chinese civilization in particular. Is Chinese civilization a secondary and derivative one, with its ultimate origin in the Middle East? Should the Chinese civilization be properly comprehended in the singular, referring to the Han civilization only? Is it correct to conceive of the origin of Chinese civilization—and of its central layer, huaxia—from a decentralized perspective? By investigating early archaeological endeavors in China and related historical discourses, this essay shows how human civilization, Chinese civilization and huaxia civilization eventually became decentralized in the scholarly understanding, particularly regarding their origins. In this decentralization of the origins of civilization, the underlying archaeology was driven by both science and politics, both rationalism and nationalism. Archaeology during the Republic of China (1912–49), which had the special mission of reconstructing Chinese national history, was guided by this dual tendency."
"The reluctant native: Or, decolonial ontologies and epistemic disobedience","Anthropologists, in regular intervals, tend to ask a cardinal question: How do we know what we know? Storms about ethnography and theory, epistemology and representation rage, and in their wake the debris of epistemic inequities, philosophical villainy, and more, scatter. What do these issues imply for those practicing the discipline outside the power centers where these issues circulate? In this essay, arguments built from the ground up will map the political economy of issues such as: what lies beneath the epistemological positions we occupy (funding, institutional structures, publishing); what are the pragmatics of the knowledge we produce or are obliged to produce (local, “area/region” knowledge); and, what slots do we occupy now (“native,” postcolonial anthropologists)? From that map, I articulate what ethnographic and epistemological potential or constraint is created by those ontologies. This leads me to transpose the cardinal anthropological question to: What can we know from where we are?"
"The Pull to the Liberal Public: Gender, Orientalism, and Peace Building in Afghanistan","Orientalist and liberal-modernist underpinnings of postconflict gender programming in Afghanistan narrowly construct Afghan women’s rights and freedoms, moving them away from the traditional domestic sphere (reliance on religious and cultural worldviews, local institutions, and informal markets) and toward a distinct path of Western liberal (colonial) modernity, focusing on women’s public roles, formal political participation, state-centric legal rights, and neoliberal market participation. This liberal-modernist bias has meant that the women’s rights agenda is bound to the few contested, hypermilitarized, and politically fragile pockets of liberal publics that are unevenly dispersed across the country and that have limited accessibility for most women. The pull to the masculine-militarized liberal publics is juxtaposed against an Orientalist framing of a stiflingly traditional society from which Afghan women are expected to flee simply because emancipatory possibilities are deemed impossible within it. This article argues that countless rural and urban women are, for many reasons, unable to or lack the desire to enter the liberal public and may not even have the choice or desire to retreat from the interpenetrating spaces of customs, values, traditions, culture, and religion. In failing to account for the complexities of women’s lives, gender programming has failed to offer a broad-based, inclusive, or flexible approach to women’s rights and gender relations."
A Sociology of Discordance: Negotiating Schemas of Deservingness and Codified Law in U.S. Asylum Status Determinations,"Asylum is one of the most significant global issues of our time. Asylum status determinations are thus a topic of great political and practical importance. This article analyzes asylum status determinations to better understand and theorize organizational legal decision-making processes. It draws on 30 interviews with U.S. asylum officers as well as case law and policy documents to develop a conceptual framework for understanding what happens, in particular, when officers’ understandings of deservingness for asylum do not match codified definitions of eligibility for asylum. The article identifies the processes through which such moments of perceived discordance between codified law and moral schemas shape frontline officials’ evaluation, advances current approaches in cultural and organizational sociology concerning the effects of moral schemas on law in action, and illuminates when and why decision makers are more or less likely to rely on preexisting biases and stereotypes, with implications for the study of inequality."
"Constructing the Field in Interwar Social Anthropology: Power, Personae, and Paper Technology","This essay draws on ideas from the history of the natural sciences—on “personae” and “paper technology”—to explain how the subculture of social anthropology emerged at the London School of Economics in the 1930s. It argues that the figure of the social anthropologist coalesced around a number of practices and symbols that Bronislaw Malinowski had done much to imbue with charisma and that his students attempted to reproduce in their own research. Historians have proposed that part of social anthropology’s success lay in its practitioners’ ability to foster a fictive individualism in their writing, cultivating an inward attitude of experience founded on acts of the self upon the self. This essay shows that the kind of knowledge produced in Malinowski’s seminar was, in fact, a highly sociable, rather than an individualistic, affair. Social anthropologists in the 1930s constructed a mutually constitutive relationship of field and seminar. These were connected spaces, held together in the act of fieldwork—a practice that transcended and linked the geographical distance between the metropole and the periphery in the crucial years of the discipline’s development."
"Dryden and Shakespeare in Barry Unsworth’s Sacred Hunger: Contrasting Emblems of Nature, Empire, and Communion","Barry Unsworth’s 1992 historical fiction novel Sacred Hunger explores the eighteenth-century slave trade while meditating upon utopian societies through an imagined community of shipwrecked enslaved people and sailors. Previous postcolonial and intertextual readings have considered connections with Shakespeare’s The Tempest, as well as its Restoration adaptation by John Dryden, The Enchanted Island. I argue that additional content from both plays informs the narrative’s ethos and characterization. Specifically, Caliban’s role is reinvented several times within the novel to subvert divisions of colonizers and colonized into predictable categories, with nature instead overruling nurture for many character attributes. At the same time, Dryden’s lessening of human agency in The Tempest reflects his underlying confidence in a divine political order, which Unsworth seizes upon as illustrative of his eighteenth-century characters’ conceptions of the world. Even the book’s title represents an overlooked allusion to Dryden’s landmark Aeneid translation that helps explain Erasmus Kemp’s unsentimental actions as a function of this imperial ethos. Finally, the novel performs something akin to an ecocritical reading of these intertexts, finding, especially in Dryden, a pronounced alienation from the natural world and its bounties. The title Sacred Hunger conceals a deeper argument about the link between food and religion, expressed via the recurring trope of the communion ceremony. This discovery sheds new light on scenes of feasting within the novel, while also helping explain the story’s framing device and Unsworth’s deeper speculations about religion, anthropology, and the attainability of utopian states."
Seeking Information: When the Court Wants More,"The State of the Union represents an opportunity for the president to share policy goals with other political actors. Thus, the State of the Union can proxy how much information the Court has about executive preferences when receiving a case. We find that the less time a president devotes to a policy area, the more likely the Court is to issue a request for a brief in a case dealing with that issue area. This finding indicates that the Court is cognizant of presidential signals of policy preferences and actively seeks to supplement its understanding of the executive’s preferences."
In Conversation: Archives and the Pandemic,"In the spring of 2020, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and a national reckoning with racism in the US, the Archives of American Art Journal invited a diverse group of scholars and artists to grapple with the question, What role can the Archives of American Art play in the midst of these public crises? In this feature, eight contributors set about mining the past, present, and possible futures of the Archives. Some turn to artists in the Archives whose work they see as offering models for addressing the epidemiological, social, and political challenges of 2020. Others reflect on using the Archives’ holdings in remote teaching and research when their access was limited to digitized collections online. Still others imagine the new work the Archives can do in a post-COVID world in which more Americans might acknowledge the racism of this country’s institutions and structures."
One year later: Reflections on the farmers’ protest in India,"Beginning November 2020, over two hundred thousand farmers have gathered in a prolonged sit-in on the borders of New Delhi. The immediate impetus for the protests was the passage of three laws that ease the entry of agribusiness into the agricultural sector. The farmers’ protests began eight months after mass protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, enacted in December 2019. This amendment to India’s Citizenship Act disbars Muslims from neighboring countries from seeking citizenship on the grounds of religious persecution. In this essay I explore some themes as they resonate across these two movements as they relate to a fundamental crisis of postcolonial nationhood. I argue that these protests have interrupted Hindu nationalism’s narrative by forging a new kind of caring crowd in which embodied acts of care create an ethical vision of citizenship. Popular politics materialized in these movements may be viewed as ongoing plebiscites on the neoliberal consensus in contemporary India."
A tree of many lives: Vegetal teleontologies in West Papua,"In this article, I analyze the ontology of the African oil palm among indigenous Marind communities in Merauke, West Papua. This introduced cash crop is conceptualized by Marind as tree and person, assailant and victim, and stranger and kin. Its ontology further multiplies through its material manifestations as plant, part, and product—from an individual stand to monocrop plantation, and from seedling to packaged oil. Drawing from two ethnographic accounts of negotiations between Marind and state and corporate actors, I then examine how Marind strategically foreground or background different facets of oil palm’s reality to serve the political ends of their activism, producing what I call “teleontologies,” or ontologies that serve an instrumental purpose. Essentializing the reality of oil palm is deemed necessary by many Marind for indigenous activism to succeed. But such essentializations are also deeply contested and can backfire unintentionally on the indigenous activists who deploy them."
Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots,"Why do politicians with strong local roots receive more electoral support? The mechanisms underlying this well-documented “friends and neighbors” effect remain largely untested. Drawing on two population-based survey experiments fielded in Britain, we provide the first experimental test of a commonly posited cue-based explanation, which argues that voters use politicians’ local roots (descriptive localism) to make inferences about politicians’ likely actions in office (behavioral localism). Consistent with the cue-based account, we find that a politician’s local roots are less predictive of voter evaluations when voters have access to explicit information about aspects of the politician’s actual behavioral localism. However, we also find that voters’ positive reaction to local roots is only partially explained by a cue-based account in which voters care about the aspects of behavioral localism tested in this article. Our findings inform a normative debate concerning the implications of friends-and-neighbors voting for democratic representation and accountability."
"Mastering the Nile? Confidence and Anxiety in D. S. George’s Photographs of the First Aswan Dam, 1899–1912","AbstractThe first Aswan Dam was built at the dawn of the twentieth century and celebrated as a triumph of imperial engineering. Five years after its completion, workers returned to extend the dam. Photographer D. S. George recorded both the building and extension projects for the Egyptian Public Works Department in a series of images that give a unique insight into the place of engineering in the imperial imagination. The dam was built at the same time as Britain was seeking to secure its domination of the Nile Valley, having recently seized control of Sudan. Mastering the river’s water was vital to expanding agriculture in Egypt, a central plank of British policy in the region. Representations of the dam speak to a larger history of empire and power in northeast Africa. This article examines the tension between bombastic confidence and nagging anxiety in the ideologies of empire. Drawing together water, engineering, and environmental histories, it explores the connections between attempts to control the politics of the Nile Valley and efforts to harness its waters. The key themes found in the albums—nature, technology, work, and conservation—will be used as lenses through which to scrutinize the peculiar form of modernity that engineers attempted to forge on the world’s longest river. This analysis reveals that imperial officials sought total mastery of the environment but that the difficulties faced in realizing such grand schemes also generated persistent anxieties and so helps us understand the fears that accompanied the ambitions of imperial modernity."
"Rawls, Piketty, and the Critique of Welfare-State Capitalism","Political philosophers have renewed their attempts to justify John Rawls’s preferred economic regime, property-owning democracy. They have followed Rawls in criticizing welfare-state capitalism because it permits unjustifiably large economic inequalities. Simultaneously, Thomas Piketty has argued that capitalism has an inherent tendency to create very high degrees of wealth and income inequality. I argue that introducing Piketty’s work into a Rawlsian framework strengthens Rawls’s critique of the welfare state and his case for property-owning democracy. Piketty’s work, if correct, shows that welfare-state capitalism not only permits unjust economic inequalities but causes and compounds them, despite the presence of various forms of redistribution. I then argue that Piketty’s solution to inequality, a global progressive tax on capital, can contribute to the aims of a property-owning democracy. This synthesis of Rawls and Piketty yields a potentially powerful left-wing yet nonsocialist critique of welfare-state capitalism."
Federal Welfare Time-Limit Extensions and Exemptions: Why Does Utilization Vary across States and over Time?,"Establishing public cash assistance as a time-limited benefit was a key and controversial feature of the 1996 welfare reform legislation. Many advocates and practitioners consider the formalization of program flexibility through time-limit exemptions and extensions to be critical in helping the most vulnerable families. Despite these options, including states’ ability to exempt up to 20 percent of their caseloads due to hardships without penalty from the federal government, uptake varies considerably over time and across states. Using multiple data sources, including federal caseload data and the Urban Institute’s Welfare Rules Database, we examine time-limit extensions and exemptions in the 50 US states from fiscal years 2002–16. Fixed-effects, negative binomial models test four theoretical models: state need and capacity, state politics, policy implementation strategies, and federal incentives. Findings indicate that states strategically respond to federal incentives and that implementation strategies matter, particularly for time-limit extensions."
Moral Values and Voting,"This paper studies the supply of and demand for moral values in recent US presidential elections. Using a combination of large-scale survey data and text analyses, I find support for the hypothesis that both voters and politicians exhibit heterogeneity in their emphasis on universalist relative to communal moral values and that politicians’ vote shares partly reflect the extent to which their moral appeal matches the values of the electorate. Over the last decade, Americans’ values have become increasingly communal—especially in rural areas—which generated increased moral polarization and is associated with changes in voting patterns across space."
A School for Modern Times: Mildred Louise Johnson and the Founding of the Modern School of Harlem,"With eight young children as students, Mildred Louise Johnson opened a private school, The Modern School (TMS), at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church in 1934. As a student in The Ethical Culture School’s Teacher Training Department (TTD), Johnson founded TMS to satisfy a graduation requirement. Her school is one example of a Northern private school that employed progressive education methods and produced high-achieving African American students and graduates. Johnson modestly described founding TMS as “an accident of the times.” This essay describes Harlem’s social, cultural, and political environment; explores Johnson’s early life and education experience at Ethical Culture, the Fieldston School, their TTD; and the founding of Camp Dunroven and TMS. Johnson’s life and work provide insight into the challenges she faced in the North as she fought for her right to train as a teacher, complete her education, and pursue a teaching career and teaching opportunities in a northern private school."
"An Exceptional Mortality: Dumped Munitions, Inconclusive Science, and the Mass Death of Oysters in the Thames Estuary after the First World War","AbstractWhen the First World War ended in November 1918, the British military was overwhelmed by logistical problems involving the disposal of leftover munitions piling up across the Western Front. To expedite disarmament, the British started dumping all manner of bombs, bullets, and chemical weapons into the seas surrounding Europe. On the surface, dumping appeared to be a miracle solution, but serious questions and concerns were raised almost immediately by bureaucrats, fishermen, scientists, and military officers, who debated its merits and limitations without a full grasp of the environmental, economic, and health implications. This debate was particularly well documented in Britain, where operations coincided with a sudden and unprecedented die-off of oysters in the Thames Estuary in 1920 and 1921. Oyster merchants blamed dumped munitions for the die off, but political and military officials remained skeptical. To resolve the issue, stakeholders turned to science, but the subsequent investigations into the mortality’s cause failed to provide definitive answers. This article examines the immense ecological and logistical implications of demobilization and the ways in which inconclusive science shaped events. It argues that demobilization and disarmament have troubling environmental histories, tied to the contamination generated by ordnance destruction and the ways in which government and military officials defined acceptable risks and controlled disposal. In the end, they used dilution to elide the uncertainty and normalize dumping operations, thereby setting precedents that shaped institutional memories about the consequences throughout the twentieth century."
Checking for a Narrower Impact of White,"Analysis of Republican Party of Minnesota v. White by political scientists shows that White had no appreciable effect on the conduct or outcome of judicial elections, including a comprehensive study of White by Chris W. Bonneau, Melinda Gann Hall, and Matthew J. Streb. Yet there is reason to believe that White may have had a more narrow impact than Bonneau, Hall, and Streb originally allowed. An extension of their original analysis is conducted, with results showing that their findings are largely robust to more tailored model specifications. Exceptions include findings on ballot roll-off, but contradictory results further support the notion that White truly had no effect."
Shameless modernity: Reflexivity and social class in Chinese personal growth groups,"Critical scholars suggest that self-help psychology discourages political activism and encourages entrepreneurship by promoting a “positive” attitude. This article complicates this finding, arguing that for Chinese youth, self-help groups reproduce class distinctions, expressed through leisure and perceived modernity, and that these groups mobilize negative affects, particularly shame. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, the article shows how Chinese youth recount shameful experiences in personal growth groups, reflecting on their perceived failures and committing to redefine themselves. Their shame induces reflexivity, or self-awareness; this reflexivity helps Chinese youth to position themselves in a highly stratified society. Furthermore, reflexive self-definition indexes social class and personal fulfillment. Youth use self-help groups as spaces in which to align their personal identity with local moral registers championing urban consumer lifestyles and modern values. Therefore, self-help practices channel negative affects into reproducing social class and into constructing an imagined national modernity."
Determinants of Writing Style on the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals,"A rapidly burgeoning literature in judicial politics concerns the variation in elements of writing style such as reading difficulty, cognitive complexity, affective language, and informality in judicial opinions. Some of these studies argue that judges strategically alter their writing style in anticipation of reactions from other actors. Others indicate that writing style is a function of judge characteristics as well as case-related factors. We investigate the correlates of writing style in US Circuit Courts of Appeals by analyzing a stratified random sample consisting of 11,771 opinions. Construing style broadly to encompass several dimensions suggested by prior work, we find that case and judge characteristics explain substantially more variance in writing style than do strategic considerations."
"Neoliberal globalization, the punitive, and the pastoral","In this contribution I draw on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in Malaysia and provide an overview of the punitive trends in legal spheres and more encompassing cultural-political domains that typically accompany neoliberal globalization. I also consider some of the pastoral developments that are commonly entangled with these trends. Finally, I point to some of the ways that my work in these areas has been inspired by Aihwa Ong’s scholarship and suggest that, going forward, pastoral modalities of care, leadership, and governance are among the themes that ethnographers of contemporary global processes and problems should prioritize."
"Royal Roads and Entangled Webs: Mining Metals and Making Value in El Cubo, Guanajuato, Mexico","In this article I study recent struggles in the gold mining town of El Cubo, Guanajuato, Mexico, over what should happen to mining profits. Rather than framing these primarily or only in terms of a chain from production to consumption and periphery to metropole, I explore them as points of intersection, divergent paths, or entangled webs. This knottier perspective, allied to a more expansive theorization of value-making as “the politics of making meaningful difference and making differences meaningful” (as I said in 2013), allows us to see these contests in a new light, as attempts to revalue places close to the mines and people with long-standing connections to those places. By doing this we can recognize the capacities of miners and others in mining communities to create and contest value in the intersections of entangled webs, rather than seeing them only as those left behind in the transfer of value along a commodity chain."
Cross-National Comparison of Parental Choice of Two-Way Bilingual Education in the United States and Israel,"This article presents a comparative analysis of a metasynthesis of Israeli and US studies on parental choice of two-way bilingual education. My analysis reveals that the reasons majority-language and minority-language parents expressed in the US and Israeli studies converge in some aspects but, significantly, also diverge. I argue that the divergences problematize the sociopsychological motivational model that dominates the analysis of parental choice of bilingual schools and lack of engagement with the general sociological literature on parental choice and lack of international comparison of school choice. I address these gaps, drawing on two sociological insights to understand parental choice of bilingual education: sociohistorical and political dynamics of the educational fields in which the choices are made and a Bourdieusian culturalist understanding of parental choice. These two perspectives can account for the potential for divergence across locales and cultures and have implications for policy makers in parental choice and bilingual education."
The Rise and Fall of Organized Crime in the United States,"The Italian American Cosa Nostra crime families are the longest-lived and most successful organized crime organizations in US history, achieving their pinnacle of power in the 1970s and 1980s. The families seized opportunities during the early twentieth-century labor wars and under national alcohol prohibition from 1919 to 1933. Control of labor unions gave them power to determine the companies that could operate in various sectors and enabled them to establish employer cartels that rigged bids and fixed prices, and provided opportunity to exploit pension and welfare funds. The racketeers were urban power brokers. The families also profited from gambling, illicit drugs, loan-sharking, prostitution, and pornography, and they extorted protection payments from other black marketeers. For decades they faced little risk from law enforcement. FBI Director Hoover denied the existence of a national organized crime threat. Local police were corrupted. After Hoover’s death, the FBI made eradicating organized crime a top priority. Relentless law enforcement coincided with socioeconomic and political changes that greatly weakened the Cosa Nostra families."
Naming with Many Names: Reimagining Origins in Marie de France’s Lais,"This essay explores how acts of naming and designation determine identities in Marie de France’s twelfth-century Lais. An artifact of the tangled cultural politics of the Angevin court in England, the Breton lai embodies a multiplicity of claims: it is a form preserved in Brittany, derived from Welsh narratives, yet rewritten presumably in England in Marie’s Île-de-France French for an audience that primarily spoke Anglo-Norman. I argue that Marie’s position at the nexus of several vernaculars reveals itself in a concern with grammatical categories and linguistic derivation. By investigating the varied circumstances under which names are lost, recovered, borrowed, and transformed, Marie undercuts traditional models of familial and literary inheritance, furnishing her Anglo-Norman readers with a narrative of cultural continuity that validates their claims to status in the insular territories."
Measuring the Issue Content of Supreme Court Opinions,"The opinions of the US Supreme Court are central to volumes of research on law, courts, and politics. To understand these complex and often-lengthy documents, scholars frequently rely on dichotomous indicators of opinion content. While sometimes appropriate, for many research settings this simplification of opinion content systematically omits important information. Using all US Supreme Court opinions from 1803 to 2010 in association with structural topic models, I instead demonstrate the value of representing the Court’s attention in opinions in terms of topic proportions."
Multiplicity and Uniqueness in Regime Change Games,"Regime change global games have become popular models in comparative politics because they ensure a unique equilibrium when coordination concerns tend to generate multiple equilibriums. This article provides an intuition for this uniqueness in a generalized regime change game and shows why public information (e.g., that the regime is relatively weak) can generate multiple equilibriums."
When Time Matters,"This essay introduces a collection of five research articles that address how time becomes materialized, regimented, politicized, and phenomenologically experienced in diverse ethnographic settings. Against notions of time’s uniformity, we explore considerations of its relational nature in physics, linguistics, and anthropology. Temporal frameworks are not given but created, not unitary but multiple, and operate in degrees of lamination, synchrony, or dissonance. In colonial Papua New Guinea, the Ecuadorian and Brazilian Amazon, highland Bolivia, and South Korea, temporal frameworks serve as anchors to diverse social and political projects. These ethnographic accounts illuminate the dynamic and consequential nature of temporal semiosis."
Underground Inspirations: Tuber Sciences and Their Histories,"Taking tuber sciences and their histories as a case study, this essay hinges on materiality, both as a condition shaping thing–human relations and as a vector for producing knowledge and generating theory. It explores how people have made knowledge about some very earthy, solid, rooted, underground things: namely, tuber crops—yams, sweet or white potatoes, manioc, and taro. Unlike the waving seas of wheat and other grand global crops that sustained the rise of our modern world, tubers were almost invisible in history of science and technology until very recently. Anthropologists, however, have been thinking with tubers, recording how humans understand and work with them, and building theories about materiality and society from these observations for over a century—and they continue to be a vibrant source of inspiration to anthropologists of materiality today. The essay discusses the contexts in which different ways of knowing-through-tubers, vernacular and academic, have been formulated and asks what inspiration these tuber tales might offer to historians of science."
“Everything New That Life Gives Birth To”: Family Values and Kinship Practices in Russian Orthodox Antiabortion Activism,"Russia is gaining a reputation for rigid gender stereotypes, ranging from hypersexualized political performance to images of deeply religious women enforcing conservative moral standards. This article argues that we can look beyond this binary by recognizing that even the conservatives work with a set of kinship-gender arrangements that are far removed from patriarchal ideals. Based on interviews with self-identified Orthodox Christian psychologists who provide pregnancy counseling as part of a church-based pronatalist movement, I examine the difference between the ideal kinship models espoused by these counselors and the actual kinship scenarios they assume when narrating interactions with clients. While expressing patriarchal ideals of male providership in a heterosexual marriage, these female counselors assume that intergenerational ties between women are more likely to provide stable support for the pregnant woman and her children. Drawing on feminist anthropological approaches to kinship as a malleable framework for the reproduction of life, I argue that the church, while promoting father-centered nuclear families, often provides support to people who live in household forms that were common during the Soviet period but have become precarious in post-Soviet Russia. Valuing single-mother and female-focused households, along with other nonconforming family models, would be a step toward supporting locally comprehensible forms of gender equality."
China’s Local Government Debt: The Grand Bargain,"China’s rapidly growing local government debt problem has long been recognized by foreign observers as a risk, but inside China, only recently was this problem called out as alarming. Why has local government debt been allowed to grow with little direct intervention from central authorities? We argue that it has much to do with a “grand bargain” between the central government and localities during the 1994 fiscal recentralization reform. While much scholarly attention has been paid to the consequences of the 1994 reform that left localities with a tremendous fiscal gap, our findings show that Beijing in fact gave localities the green light to create new backdoor financing institutions that counteracted the impact of fiscal recentralization. In essence, these institutions were the quid pro quo offered to localities to sustain their incentive for local state-led growth after 1994. The bargain worked, and growth continued. The drawback, however, was that China’s economic growth has been accompanied by the accumulation of local government debt with little transparency and central control. When the global financial crisis slowed growth, and local deficits and debts spiked, Beijing began to shut down backdoor financing and opened front-door options that were transparent and under the control of national authorities—but with limited success. In the wake of COVID-19, the question is whether the pendulum will swing back toward more tolerance of local debt for the sake of economic growth."
Decolonial Time in Bolivia’s Pachakuti,"Debates about cultural practices in Bolivia have increasingly unfolded around questions of which practices are deemed essentially indigenous or essentially Western and demands for decolonization, or the reestablishment of indigenous cultural hegemony. This article examines cases in which the construal of time (through calendars, clocks, and notions of the past and future) is depicted as being either essentially Andean or a colonial import and, thus, a target for reform. Advancing competing construals of time has become a feature of such contemporary state-led political interventions as reorienting clock faces on public buildings; reconciling the Gregorian calendar with an agricultural, Aymara one; replacing Spanish loanwords for the days of the week with neologisms; and framing the launching of a telecommunications satellite as the reconstitution of pre-Hispanic astronomical science. These debates draw on a salient difference in the space-time semantics of Andean languages. Aymara and Quechua are typologically unusual for linking front space with past time and anterior space with the futurity and for sharing a unified concept of “space-time,” or pacha, a term that has become popularized through the widespread use of pachakuti ‘the turning over of space-time’, to refer to what, in other contexts, might be called revolution."
"Anger, Aggression, Attitude: Intersex Rage as Biopolitical Protest","This article argues that anger, aggression, and attitude viscerally shape intersex survival and resilience. Far from being toxic, antisocial emotions, these affects manifest rage’s eloquence by critically challenging the sexual and racial logics at the heart of intersex medical pathologization and nonconsensual surgical normalization. Tracing how affective transmission bridges politics across time, this article explores what I call, after Audre Lorde, the uses of negativity—the ways in which people are affected by and mobilize negative affects in their lived experiences to process and respond to stigma, shame, and state-sanctioned medical and other forms of violence. Analyzing transmissions of intersex anger, rage, and associated affects in the early 1990s activism of the Intersex Society of North America, the award-winning documentary Intersexion, and the Intersex Justice Project, I argue that intersex rage has helped to create a transnational legacy of biopolitical protest. I offer the term biopolitical protest to name a politic that contests the regulation of human life through the medicalization and pathologization of intersex, trans, and gender-nonconforming bodyminds and to expose the administration of sexual dimorphism and binary gender as tactics of racial capitalism."
Do Transitional Justice Museums Persuade Visitors? Evidence from a Field Experiment,"Do transitional justice museums persuade visitors? We implement a novel field experiment at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, Chile, to understand the effects of governments’ attempts to shape citizens’ attitudes through symbolic transitional justice policies such as museums and memorials. Our findings suggest that though perceptions of the museum vary along ideological lines, Chilean university students display greater support for democratic institutions, are more likely to reject institutions associated with the repressive period, and are more supportive of restorative transitional justice policies after visiting regardless of their ideological priors. We test for the persistence of these results and find that some of the effects endure for six months following the museum visit. We find support for the notion that emotional appeals deployed in the museum can shift citizen attitudes, which might have implications for processes of reconciliation."
“A mad exuberance”: The globalization of luxury,"The issue of the circulation of luxury commodities and of the evolution through which it is going becomes fully meaningful when addressed within the context of an anthropology of globalization that analyzes the nature and impact of flows on contemporary societies. In this article, I explore the ways in which globalization not only affects the luxury economy but also reshapes its cultural and political dimensions. The first part of this essay examines the definition of luxury and its close link with such notions as scarcity, superfluity, and expenditure, and reviews the theoretical debate on luxury and the development of capitalism. The second part is focused on the global expansion of the luxury market, especially its opening to Chinese consumers. A consequence of this appropriation of luxury goods on a large scale is the permanent threat of banalization in a domain in which scarcity and exceptionality are so essential. In this context, the close connection between luxury firms and contemporary art can be interpreted as an antidote against this process of banalization."
How Organizational Minorities Form and Use Social Ties: Evidence from Teachers in Majority-White and Majority-Black Schools,"This article draws on 11 months of multisite ethnographic fieldwork and 103 interviews to investigate how teachers in school faculty of varying racial compositions form and use their social ties to secure professional, political, and emotional resources at work. Findings show that, in general, white teachers in the numerical minority in their schools secured all resource types through their same-race ties, while black teachers in the numerical minority secured primarily emotional resources from their same-race ties. Given these observed differences, the author shows how the form and use of the two minority groups’ social ties stem in large part from distinctive organizational practices. In turn, the tie differences can account for differences in social integration and resource access in the organization. The data allow for comparisons to patterns among majority groups."
Marching Drums: An Enhanced Framework for Identifications and Securitizations,"This article lays out a framework for integrating identifications into securitization theory in order to specifically and systematically illuminate the role that identifications play in determining securitization success and in delimiting effective securitization rhetoric. I outline the framework, its theoretical backing as derived from cognitive, identity, and discourse studies, its potential use, and some empirical findings emerging from its current application. The framework holds that identifications consistently affect audience receptivity to securitization rhetoric, but only in certain circumstances (namely, when identifications are strong and thick) does their precise content restrict the parameters and performative power of effective securitization rhetoric. The framework draws insights from the fields of cognitive science, social psychology, and identity studies, and it emphasises a context-specific approach to securitization studies that inquires into, rather than assumes, local situations. As such, the article aims to inform securitization scholars engaged in a range of studies of how they can incorporate local audiences into their work without imposing a universalist logic of security onto disparate circumstances."
The Impact of Court-Ordered District Elections on City Finances,"In 1972, the representation of blacks on city councils was only half of their share of the US population. Starting in 1975, courts sought to increase minority representation by ruling at-large city council elections unconstitutional in jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination. Economic theory suggests that this court-induced shift toward district elections could lead to a common-pool problem and thus to greater government noninfrastructure spending. This paper provides empirical evidence that cities that adopt district elections increase noninfrastructure spending, thus providing empirical support for the common-pool problem. Since political institutions seldom change, the shift of US cities to district elections may be long-lasting, which suggests that the goals of equal representation and effective governance may be at odds."
Interjurisdictional Competition and Policy Preferences of the Public,"The federal structure of the US government provides states and localities with significant autonomy in many policy domains. Prior research provides evidence that jurisdictions compete with one another in several of these domains. This evidence, however, comes almost exclusively from the decisions of political elites and provides little insight into potential public responsiveness to interjurisdictional competition. In this paper, we leverage a statewide referendum on education funding levels in Oklahoma to examine whether the degree of competition from across state borders systematically affected public support for increased educational funding. Results indicate that voting precincts facing stiff educational competition from school districts in other states supported the referendum at higher rates than precincts facing little competitive pressure. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase on our index of educational competition increases support for the referendum by one to two percentage points."
Feminist Digital Counterpublics: Challenging Femicide in Kenya and South Africa,"What happens when misogyny leads to increasing murders of women, whose lives are considered not worthy because their respectability is under attack? What do feminists do in a global moment when antifeminist backlash emerges with fervor in politics, policy, and social spaces to reverse and challenge feminist progress? Rage happens. This article explores the role of rage in the development of African feminist digital counterpublics on Twitter. Through two Twitter hashtags, #MenAreTrash and #JusticeForSharon, I illuminate how anger emanating from increasing rates of femicide in Kenya and South Africa catalyzes the evolution of feminist communities of knowledge, solidarity, and resistance on Twitter. The rage illustrated in this article is considered in relation to longer histories of burnout and fatigue with nonresponse from the state and from male allies. Through these digital spaces, a process of building alliances and challenging antifeminist movements emerges. Feminist engagements around these hashtags are a site of concrete resistance against online misogyny as well as its material manifestations through femicide. In a context where antifeminist movements see digital spaces as sites to mobilize antifeminist sentiment, paying attention to digital feminist counterpublics is critical to understanding gender justice and freedom."
The Geopolitics of “Rape Kit” Protocols: Historical Problems in Translation as Humanitarian Medicine Meets International Law,"This article contributes to historiographies of forensic medicine by examining late twentieth-century women’s rights activism for new clinical standards on medical forensic exams for sexual assault (commonly known as “rape kits”). I argue that three features of these exams distinguish new standards of care from older practices in forensic medicine: the addition of specialized medical care to evidence-collection routines; attention to psychological trauma; and the creation of specific protocols to standardize, professionalize, and guide routine administration of the exam. To illustrate this shift, I follow “rape kit” protocols that emerged within nursing in the United States beginning in the 1970s, to their uptake and codification in international guidelines, to more recent attempts to adapt them for use in conflict zones. New clinical guidelines transformed the “rape kit” into an assemblage of instruments, medical routines, and new ways of thinking about sexual assault. The rape kit assemblage simultaneously became a traveling technology of care and a technology of governance and law. In practice, however, as new standards were implemented more widely, tensions between medical care and evidence collection emerged. At the intersection of law and medicine, distinct logics and assumptions came together, positioning not only medical and legal professionals, but also patients, in the unenviable liminal zone in which care and justice met and produced friction. This comes across clearly from an analysis of their use in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where mass rape had taken place. In this context, political turmoil and war conditioned the delivery of health care and, by extension, the liminal zone between medicine and law that standards for post-rape care occupy. Investigations of mass rape threatened to contravene confidentiality of medical records and expose health workers and patients to retaliation from suspects, renewing controversies surrounding the feasibility of aligning the institutional logics of medicine and law in this way."
"Memory in Interaction: Gender-Based Violence, Genocide, and Commemoration","Societies often institutionally commemorate histories marred by atrocity crimes through the development of permanent memorials in efforts to create a national collective memory. While scholars have documented the gendered silences within collective memories more generally, the processes that variously enforce and/or break such silences are less clear. In analyzing these silences—as well as resistance against them—across three memorials in Rwanda, I argue that memorial characteristics (physicality, orientation, and internal structure) affect the extent to which certain narratives of victimhood are remembered or forgotten. By analyzing the dynamics of memorialization on a micro level, what I call “memory-in-interaction,” we can better understand the process through which national narratives come to exclude or include experiences of gendered violence. Such processes reveal that a difficult past, such as one wrought with mass rape, can be silenced, even within a political climate in which women are otherwise heavily represented in government, policy, and civic life, suggesting that women’s promising inclusion in some public realms does not ensure their inclusion in others."
The History of Geology Meets Disasters: A Brazilian Perspective,"Popular belief holds that Brazil is a “blessed country,” where hurricanes, severe earthquakes, volcanoes, and other intense natural disasters do not occur. A closer look, however, reveals many examples that contradict these assumptions. Brazil has been living under the impact of severe environmental, cultural, and political disasters for centuries. Paradigmatic examples in recent years were the fire that destroyed the building and most of the collections of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro in September 2018 and the rupture of a dam associated with mining activities in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, in January 2019. Taking a longer view, this essay focuses on Brazilian volcanism and earthquakes since the sixteenth century, asking what these subjects can tell us about the histories of disasters and geological sciences, in Brazil and the world."
A Neoliberal Grammar of Schooling? How a Progressive Charter School Moved toward Market Values,"Although initially ideologically diverse, the charter school movement has become increasingly aligned with neoliberal ideology, which assumes that public services, including education, are improved through market forces, such as accountability, competition, efficiency, and managerialism. Yet little is known about how leaders of ideologically progressive charter schools sustain their founding pedagogical and political missions amid widespread market values. This qualitative case study of one progressive charter school in New York City investigates this phenomenon. Findings demonstrate that the school’s enrollment, instructional, school governance, and community engagement practices moved toward market values as school leaders and board trustees prioritized attaining favorable test outcomes, garnering resources, and ensuring the renewal of the school’s charter. Findings illustrate a neoliberal grammar of schooling, or powerful forces that led school leaders to move their practices toward market values, in turn constraining the realization of the school’s founding progressive mission."
The Economic Effects of International Administrations: The Cases of Kosovo and East Timor,"Does the involvement of foreign third parties in the management of a country in the wake of a civil war have positive or negative economic effects? The approaches used to address this question in the social and political science literature are mostly qualitative and not sufficiently supported by quantitative evidence. This paper uses a quantitative analysis of the postconflict economic performance of Kosovo and East Timor under international administrations sponsored by the United Nations in the late 1990s. By using the synthetic control impact evaluation technique, we compute suitable counterfactual scenarios for each country to estimate the intervention effects of interest. We find a robust negative effect from the intervention on Kosovo, whereas the effect on East Timor is positive."
Omissions and Silences in My Navajo Fieldwork: From Kinship Studies to Gendered Life Histories,"Using long-term research in a Navajo community as an example, this paper examines how the social construction of anthropological research (including theoretical frameworks and writing strategies) shapes the silences and omissions in any particular historical period. Gender, ethnicity, age, and economic/political transformation also play roles unveiling some omissions while creating others as relationships shift and deepen over decades. I outline three major periods: the 1960s, when a social science model that emphasized theoretical problems, data analysis, and objectivist prose held sway; the 1970s, when feminist anthropology reoriented analysis to a focus on women, power, and authority; and the “dialogic turn,” when ethnography began to include women’s voices, the presence of the anthropologist in the text, and attention to the power relationship between the researcher and the interviewee. Each period entails its own omissions and silences, but acknowledging them allows anthropologists to make more provisional conclusions and be forward looking, seeking ways to shift our future theoretical frameworks and reinterpret our observations."
Camera Ocupa,"This essay compares—and analyzes the gap between—photographs taken by an ethnographer (myself) and photographs taken by interlocutors during a 64-day protest occupation of a public high school in one of Rio de Janeiro’s working-class neighborhoods. My photos (figs. 1–4, 9–10) foreground upended spatial and social arrangements in the fashion of Global North movements such as Occupy Wall Street. In contrast, the photos taken by the students (or ocupas; figs. 5–8) are instruments for thinking materially across a history that includes but exceeds strictly present spatial arrangements. They are not objective representations of static, unyielding space (and its ruination), but rather reminders of a not-so-distant history, gesturing toward radical contingency and the possibility of vindicated social and political rights. Taking as its starting point both the photographs of the ethnographer and those of the interlocutors—cultural production in their own right—the photo-essay proposes a methodology that proceeds by retroactively mining the gap between the two for insights. Taking a cue from proponents of multimodality, it concludes by making an argument for taking images as seriously as words, pointing to the implications of such a move for the way we study the uses and meanings of media as they intersect with vanguard youth cultures in the contemporary moment."
Educating Transnationally Mobile Students: A Multidimensional Framework,"The back and forth migration of children and youth between the United States and Mexico has created a unique group of approximately nine million “students we share” who have been educated in both countries (Jensen and Sawyer 2013). The social, political, and economic interconnectivity of the United States and Mexico suggests that these trends are likely to continue, making the education of transnationally mobile students, or those students who have formative schooling experiences in both countries, a topic in critical need of research. This article presents findings from a systematic literature review and describes how sociopolitical, sociocultural, sociolinguistic, and socioemotional factors influence transnationally mobile students’ educational experiences. We assert that future research on transnational education within the US-Mexico nexus and beyond should attend to the interconnectedness of these dimensions, rather than viewing them in isolation."
Building resilience into water management through public engagement,"Water resources of the United States (US), most of which are associated with river basins and managed by water utilities, are influenced by multiple landowners and land uses across diverse political jurisdictions with varying stakeholder interests. Water utilities occupy a challenging domain where they are tasked with simultaneously providing affordable and safe water while maintaining environmental quality. When periodic crises occur, the water users are often poorly prepared to understand the tradeoffs and consequences of water management decisions. The increasing prevalence of water insecurity in the US and globally creates both opportunity and necessity to use public engagement with science (PES) to enhance the sustainability of water resources. We consider PES to include a range of knowledge necessary to develop a resilient and sustainable water management strategy based on ecological, environmental, and engineering principles. We suggest that global water insecurity creates a PES opportunity for the Society for Freshwater Science and similar technical and scientific organizations. We provide examples and explore PES actions that serve as a guide for engagement. Fundamental to PES in natural resources management is creating a culture of mutual learning among groups with different interests and responsibilities, in this case researchers, water managers, conservation organizations, and the public as water users. We also provide a case study of successful PES based on our experience with the Upper Flint River Working Group (UFRWG) in Georgia, USA. The UFRWG has been working to promote water sustainability for 7 y and illuminates a critically important aspect of PES: that engagement must be responsive to the diverse experiences of stakeholders (in resources, expertise, capacity, timelines, lexicon, political economy, and so on) and be planned over appropriate timeframes to ensure success in the realm of process as well as results. The UFRWG can point to improved communication between utilities, early recognition of potential water scarcity, aggressive conservation measures, changing attitudes towards land application of wastewater vs return flows of treated water, and consideration of urban green infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff as evidence of success. Changes in water management that have been made by the UFRWG are a testament that PES strategies can be powerful tools in the natural resources management arena."
Local Conflict Intensity and Public Perceptions of the Police: Evidence from Afghanistan,"What are the effects of internal armed conflict on public perceptions of the police? We explore this research question in the context of Afghanistan and argue that local conflict intensity will have a negative impact on how individuals evaluate the police as a key state institution, as it affects both how effective and how just police conduct is at the local level. We evaluate this proposition by employing a multilevel modeling approach that analyzes the effect of local conflict intensity on perceptions of the police among 31,720 Afghans across a sample of 360 districts (2007–12). Results indicate that the higher the local conflict intensity, the less likely individuals are to perceive the police as being effective in fighting crime, procedurally just, and trustworthy. Our study contributes to both the political science literature on the institutional consequences of violent conflicts and the literature on state-building and institutional legitimacy."
"Needham, Matter, Form, and Us","Joseph Needham offered a vision of history that united his understanding of the physical world with his interpretation of social process, in which the material, social, and ideal realms were reciprocally constituted. This essay explores Needham’s ideas about matter and form to show how he developed a systematic theory of materialism in his early writings on science and social change. Shifting the ground of discourse in Needham’s project from “science” to “materialism,” the essay brings him into conversation with new materialists to reflect on the ongoing challenges in theorizing the relationship between social and material phenomena. Calling into question an all-encompassing materiality that sacrifices the role of determinate structures and histories in the production of the world, the essay asks: How can we formulate a framework of material/-ity/-ism that does not dispense with or occlude the already embedded politics of culture, social relations of production, and historical contingency?"
Party System Institutionalization and Economic Voting: Evidence from India,"It is well established that a country’s institutional features can weaken economic voting because voters find it hard to attribute performance to specific parties. We argue that local-level party system institutionalization similarly moderates the link between the economy and vote choice. We focus on one manifestation of party system institutionalization: the strength of party-candidate linkages in elections, operationalized by manually tracing the rerunning patterns of some 80,000 candidates in Indian state elections between 1986 and 2007. Using rerunning patterns to measure party-candidate linkages and rainfall data to measure the state of the economy, we show that voters were more likely to reward incumbent parties for economic performance when parties and candidates were aligned in consecutive elections. We address concerns of endogeneity in rerunning patterns, by showing that the results are robust to alternate measures of local-level party system institutionalization. They are also robust to alternative measures of the state of the economy and to using individual-level survey data."
Explaining an Early Modern Magnum Opus,"This essay explains the approach used to formulate a historical explanation behind the early modern natural philosophy of Benito Arias Montano, as articulated in his Anima, Corpus, and Vestis trilogy, works he considered his magnum opus. This involved inquiring into his personal motivations, identifying the epistemological and methodological issues concerning natural philosophy he found to be in need of reform, and situating these within the social, economic, religious, and political imperatives that drove these issues and, as a consequence, the textual effort that resulted in the magnum opus. The research program outlined here also sought to expand our understanding of the imperatives driving natural philosophy in sixteenth-century Spain."
Voices from the Inside: Lived Experiences of Women Confined in a Detention Center,"Drawing on two years of fieldwork, this article focuses on the lived experiences of women detained inside Rome’s Identification and Expulsion Center, the main migration-related detention facility in Italy. We employed a thematic narrative analysis to examine the narratives of five women with different life trajectories in order to identify continuities and discontinuities within and across their stories. This analysis reveals that women’s experiences of oppression and agency—in their countries of origin, transit, and settlement—are deeply intertwined and strongly influenced by structural forces. Gender and sexuality, in relation to other hierarchies of power such as class, race, and nationality, profoundly shape such experiences, becoming crucial in the production of women as excludable and deportable subjects. Further, as the accounts of our participants lay bare, the immigration control system appears to play a key role in the (re)production of a dominant normative order. However, women are not passive spectators of the violence to which they are forcibly exposed. Rather, they struggle to cope with and resist the regimes of power that oppress their everyday lives. Through a feminist stance, this contribution seeks to enrich the body of scholarship on the lived experiences of women subject to practices of immigration and border control, particularly those confined in detention centers. Moreover, it highlights the need for a feminist project based on the creation of political and affective alliances across borders and axes of difference, particularly those related to legally produced statuses."
“Mafiacraft” and mafia activity: A dynamic and changing interaction,"Deborah Puccio-Den has conducted ethnographic research in Palermo since the mid-1990s, focusing on efforts to criminalize the mafia, both on the part of the criminal justice system, and also by ordinary citizens, among them photographers, artists, writers, social scientists, journalists, and antimafia activists. She proposes the word “mafiacraft” to conceptualize this process, evoking anthropological analyses of efforts to criminalize witches. The analogy dramatizes how much violence has occurred in modern Sicily without either prosecutors or morally sensitive Sicilians being able to identify, much less agree upon, those responsible. Puccio-Den acknowledges that “historical and political conditions” influence turning points in the ability of both sets of actors to concretize responsibility (“responsibilize,” as she puts it). Because the author does not touch on these conditions, I have taken the liberty to elaborate on two that I consider crucial: Sicily’s postwar struggle for agrarian reform, and the island’s becoming a hub for heroin trafficking to the United States in the “long 1980s.”"
The Humanist Pompeo Pazzaglia: An Unknown Renaissance Poet,"This article introduces the little-known humanist Pompeo Pazzaglia of Bologna (Pompeius Bononiensis). Drawing on the evidence of two collections of his works preserved in miscellaneous manuscripts, it not only reconstructs his biography, but also showcases a selection of his Neo-Latin poems, published and translated here for the first time. Moreover, it publishes some letters and writings which provide new information about book history as well as social, cultural and political events in mid-fifteenth-century Italy, especially in the ambit of Pomponio Leto’s Roman Academy, the papal curia and the court of Naples. Pompeo’s previously unstudied writings yield unique insights into such diverse subjects as the decoration and symbolism of the Roman Pantheon and the Palazzo di San Marco, the marriage of Ippolita Maria Sforza and King Ferrante in Naples, the death of Jacopo Piccinino (1465) and the fall of Negroponte to the Ottomans (1471). This study therefore makes a valuable contribution to scholarship on early Renaissance humanism in Rome and Aragonese Naples."
A Separation-of-Powers Approach to the Supreme Court’s Shrinking Caseload,"Since the end of the 1980s the Supreme Court has cut its caseload nearly in half. While this decrease has not gone unnoticed, researchers have largely focused their explanations on institutional factors, such as changes in personnel, creation of the certiorari pool, or an increase in the amount of discretion justices have to set their agenda. Most existing work fails to consider how the preferences of members of Congress and the president also contribute to this staggering decrease. I provide the first systematic examination of how extrainstitutional influences affect the size of the Court’s caseload. I examine the 1951–2016 terms of the Court to reveal that a constraining political environment significantly reduces the number of cases the justices agree to hear each term. These results suggest that the justices consider the preferences of actors in the other branches of government much earlier than their decisions on the merits."
The Effect of “Do Everything” on “Unity in Diversity”: A Neopluralist Examination of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the General Federation of Women’s Clubs,"The neopluralist approach to interest groups emphasizes how context affects group development and survival. Yet these studies focus on modern-day interest populations and not those from the past, when the development of politically oriented voluntary associations occurred in less dense and less competitive environments. Here, we study the effect of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (the Union), the largest women’s association of the late nineteenth century, on what became the largest women’s association of the early twentieth century, the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (the General Federation). There are three main findings. First, membership growth was mutually supportive; larger state-level membership in the Union predicts later General Federation membership strength. Second, in states with larger Union memberships, state General Federation associations had fewer clubs. Combined, these two findings suggest that Union membership constrained the General Federation’s organizational growth while still supporting the expansion of its membership. Third, greater percentages of women’s clubs joined directly with the national General Federation in states with smaller state-level Union and General Federation memberships, indicating efforts to build greater connections with women nationally when state-level environments were not as conducive to women’s widespread engagement in these two major associations."
Natural Resources and Conflict in Africa: What Do the Data Show?,"The empirical relationship between natural resources and conflict in Africa is not very well understood. Using a novel geocoded data set, we are able to construct a quasi-natural experiment to explore the causal effects of oil field and mineral discoveries on intrastate armed conflict in Africa at the grid cell level corresponding to a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° latitude and longitude. We find no evidence of resource discoveries triggering conflict after controlling for property rights institutions, past discoveries, grid cell and year fixed effects, grid cell–specific trends, and country-year fixed effects. Resource discoveries are associated with improved local living standards and increased political patronage, both of which reduce conflict. We observe little or no heterogeneity in the relationship across resource types, discovery size, distance to discovery and borders, and institutions. The relationship remains unchanged at a higher grid cell resolution and at the regional and national levels."
"Lay Authority and Meaningful Portraiture on Mount Papikion, Thrace","This article examines instances and modes of interaction between monasticism and lay society in Late Byzantium. Offering a rare view of the little-known and decontextualized monastery of Linos located on Mount Papikion in Thrace, the hinterland of the empire, this study attempts to unveil the devotional practices and philanthropic activity of local communities in the fourteenth century. An anonymous donor portrait discovered in the narthex of the monastic church sheds light on the key role of lay families in making and sustaining rural monastic establishments amidst the turmoil of war, political dysfunction, and territorial shrinkage. In contextualizing and reconsidering the foundation process of the Linos Monastery, this analysis reveals the nature and magnitude of lay patronage within the broader social realities of the fourteenth century. Unlike data for other parts of the empire, the evidence on monastic renewal or production of painted decoration in Thrace tends to lack social documentation, especially in a period that has often been characterized as the age of patronage. Though numerous monastic complexes across the Byzantine countryside bear witness to an exceptional trend of generous benefactions on the part of laymen and women, the difference in the case of Linos lies in its setting on a holy mountain. A close reading of the archaeological site and the fragmentary painted decoration contributes to our understanding of women’s accessibility to holy mountains through pious donations and the commissioning of their images on church walls."
"Early Pacific Encounters and Masculinity: War, Sex, and Christianity in Hawai‘i","Anthropology explores gender as a social construct, performed in a variety of ways that are shaped by social and economic conditions and are part of a sex/gender system. Analyzing masculinities during a period of encounter between two very different sex/gender systems provides a valuable way to see how the ideals of masculinity shape these interactions, how they change, and to what extent they remain stable despite dramatic political and economic change. In the first 50 years of encounter in Hawai‘i, from 1778 to about 1830, a prosperous set of chiefdoms encountered a wave of European and American explorers, merchants, whalers, and missionaries arriving on its shores. Tracing how the newcomers’ ideas of masculinity intersected with those of the Hawaiians shows how areas of convergence and divergence in the sex/gender systems shaped the nature of the interactions and, to some extent, the relative power of each side."
“All These Are the Twelve Tribes of Israel”: The Origins of Israel’s Kinship Identity,"The Hebrew Bible presents Israel as a community of twelve tribes descending from one common ancestor. As an elementary social construction, this notion functions as the basic code for Israel’s collective identity. In this article, the author investigates the nature and the origins of the Israelite tribal system. It is readily apparent that the construct of the twelve tribes does not match the social reality or the shape of any given political entity in any period within the history of Israel. This holds true for the postexilic as well as the preexilic monarchic periods. Sources for earlier periods, however, allow for some cautious conclusions on the existence and shape of northern Israelite and Judahite kinship structures, which in time developed into the system of the twelve tribes of Israel."
Signals from the Hunt: Widening the Spectrum on Male Pursuits of Dangerous Animals,"With a long history predating modern humans, big-game hunting has been implicated in catalyzing human evolution through nutritional and provisioning benefits. An alternative view argues for this practice as a costly signaling strategy geared toward increasing male fitness through prestige and status benefits. We examine this possibility across contexts that include early human evolutionary phases, as well as historical and contemporary time periods. Our interpretive exploration across several disciplinary literatures covers hunting in the hominin evolutionary past, extant hunter-gatherers, and finally, political and cultural big-game hunting and sport as recounted in historical and mythological narratives. In some of these, we find strong support for costly signaling as a beneficial strategy. Further, in contexts where subsistence is not an articulated motivation for hunting, we argue that benefits accrued through male-to-male signaling and resulting status as measured through prestige and dominance could be a key component of social hierarchies and, ultimately, fitness outcomes."
Rules of Descent and Pattern of Authority among the Bakor of Southern Nigeria,"The Bakor is one of the very few ethnic groups in Nigeria believed to practice a matrilineal descent system. There is either a common assumption that matriliny connotes matriarchy or a confusion between the two concepts among some African feminist scholars. Against this backdrop, this study sought to find out the prevailing rules of descent and the pattern of authority in Bakor society, where women constitute the currency for lineage tracing and inheritance. Data were collected from indigenous adult female and male participants of different sociodemographic backgrounds through twelve in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussion sessions. The study occurred in four rural and two urban communities among six Bakor clans using a qualitative research design. The results indicate a double descent system; patrilocality; matrifocality; women’s active participation in the economic, political, and social spheres; and their legitimate access to decision-making despite the preponderant patriarchal attitudes and practices. Although it is patriarchal, women have relative autonomy in the Bakor double descent system."
"Affect, sociality, and the construction of paternalistic citizenship among family caregivers in China","In recent years, the Chinese state has made family members care for and manage persons diagnosed with serious mental illnesses. Many of these caregivers are also former socialist workers to whom the state has broken its promise of paternalism. This article examines the affective experience, sociality, and citizenship claims of these caregivers. My fieldwork shows that, despite state agents’ attempts to depoliticize their feelings, caregivers construct narratives of suffering together, which allow them to make sense of their systemic marginalization and the state’s hypocrisy. They engage in complicit but righteous searches for welfare, healthcare, and leisure resources together, while also publicly demanding the state’s recognition of and support for themselves and their loved ones. I examine the promises and perils of this “paternalistic citizenship” as exemplified by caregivers, and consider the affective transformations it needs to open new political horizons."
"Category Romances, Cozy Mysteries, and Civic Virtues: Justifying the Promotion of Popular Fiction in the Public Library","The active promotion of adult popular fiction in the public library is in need of theoretical justification consistent with that institution’s larger political project, a project it is sometimes said to undermine. In this article, the author surveys genre fiction’s modern-day discontents in the library field, then proceeds to consider a series of candidate justifications currently on offer in the LIS literature in an effort to resolve the alleged conflict between promoting fiction primarily read for entertainment and advancing democratic ideals. Upon revealing the empirical and theoretical inadequacies of each of these extant justifications, the author develops and defends an alternative in which popular fiction—and, more precisely, genuine aesthetic experience—serves as a resource for the development of dispositions necessary to democratic citizenship. Adopting this justification has far-reaching consequences for the ways in which librarians design and provide recreational reader services to adult patrons."
Cultural and Cognitive Autonomy: Teacher Positioning and Motivational Practices for Emergent Bilingual Students,"This study examined 10 urban middle school teachers’ practices to motivate their emergent bilingual students (or English-language learners) and the ways in which their practices were associated with their positioning of their students in reading intervention classrooms. Our findings showed that teacher positioning that afforded or constrained their own and their students’ various thoughts and behaviors was associated with the teachers’ various practices to support emergent bilingual students’ autonomy. The teachers’ positioning of themselves and their students as cultural beings, by rejecting dominant narratives, was associated with their support of autonomy on cognitive and managerial levels and was frequently combined with autonomy support on cultural levels. By considering critical race theory and achievement motivation theory, our findings suggest the need to pay critical attention to teachers’ positioning in sociocultural and political contexts to better support their practices to motivate and engage emergent bilingual students."
“I Learned That My Name Is Spelled Wrong”: Lessons from Mexico and Nepal on Teaching Literacy for Indigenous Language Reclamation,"Globally many minority and Indigenous communities are searching for ways to reclaim languages that have been marginalized by socioeconomic and political processes. These efforts often involve novel literacy practices. In this article, we draw from ethnographic data in Mexico and Nepal to ask, what are the opportunities and constraints of teaching writing in support of Indigenous language reclamation? Writing is simultaneously an attraction and a source of marginalization or discouragement for learners in both settings. Promoting and teaching writing creates opportunities such as raising the status, visibility, and longevity of Indigenous language education initiatives. Challenges include struggles for legitimacy among teachers and learners and the emergence of new hierarchies among dialects. We suggest that language reclamation efforts can benefit from making the most of the material and social nature of writing and from avoiding hard-line purism and a focus on form, while giving greater consideration to meaning and contexts for written expression."
Just a Number? Voter Evaluations of Age in Candidate-Choice Experiments,"Around the world, humans are living longer and politicians are getting older. But what do voters think about politicians of advanced age? We conduct a meta-analysis of 16 conjoint design-based candidate-choice experiments in seven democracies, revealing that older hypothetical candidates are consistently less likely to be favored by respondents—whether compared to the youngest alternative or the second-oldest alternative. We then report the findings of a novel conjoint experiment on Japanese voters designed to elicit whether the milestone of entering a new decade of age (70 vs. 69 years) affects respondents’ preferences for hypothetical candidates. Although at most 730 days separate candidates of these ages (limiting concerns of substantial differences in health or fitness), we find a significant penalty for the older candidate. Together, our findings highlight the mismatch between voters’ preferences for younger politicians and the ostensible gerontocracy that governs much of the world."
Projecting Confidence: How the Probabilistic Horse Race Confuses and Demobilizes the Public,"Recent years have seen a dramatic change in horse-race coverage of elections in the United States—shifting focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that emphasize candidates’ chance of victory. Could this shift in the political information environment affect election outcomes? We use experiments to show that forecasting increases certainty about an election’s outcome, confuses many, and decreases turnout. Furthermore, we show that election forecasting has become prominent in the media, particularly in outlets with liberal audiences, and show that such coverage tends to more strongly affect the candidate who is ahead—raising questions about whether they contributed to Trump’s victory over Clinton in 2016. We bring empirical evidence to this question, using American National Election Studies data to show that Democrats and Independents expressed unusual confidence in a decisive 2016 election outcome—and that the same measure of confidence is associated with lower reported turnout."
Elamite War Chariots and Military Equipment At Ancient Kabnak (ca. 1400 bce),"After entering the second millennium BCE as a military superpower, Elam faded into historical obscurity upon its withdrawal from the broader Near Eastern political scene in 1763 BCE and only reemerged much later as a major player with a sequence of incursions in Mesopotamia beginning in the thirteenth century and culminating in the 1155 BCE fall of the Kassites. During the intervening centuries, neither written nor archaeological sources offer clear signs that Elamite territory had come under the authority of any foreign power. Here the authors propose that a reexamination of evidence from the ancient settlement of Kabnak (modern Haft Tepe), approximately seventeen kilometers southeast of the Elamite lowland capital of Susa, discloses a mid-fifteenth to mid-fourteenth century BCE state-controlled arsenal of war chariots and weaponry that may hold a key to comprehending Elam’s apparent continued resistance to outside forces and its rise as a military superpower in the thirteenth century."
The Muskrat’s New Frontier: The Rise and Fall of an American Animal Empire in Britain,"AbstractIn the early 1930s, many British politicians, journalists, and scientists were greatly alarmed by the feral exploits of a recently introduced North American furbearer that readily escaped confinement. The uncontainable muskrat precipitated Britain’s first legislation to combat non-native invasive species (NIS), triggering a campaign of extermination that was successful within five years, representing a rare instance of mission accomplished in the global history of efforts to eliminate NIS. The short, but intensive, British chapter in the muskrat’s history has attracted just one historian to date. Thirty years ago, John Sheail foregrounded alarm-raising scientists’ efforts to engender political action and provided a detailed account of the Destructive Imported Animals Act’s passage and provisions. Yet many questions remain. How do we explain the acute level of anxiety over the muskrat? How do we account for the surprising ease with which the species was wiped out? And why was there such a spectacular difference between projected and actual numbers at large? These matters will all be touched on, but the novel vantage point adopted is that of the frontier, as understood in the United States and Europe. This requires a broader geographical context than Sheail’s, embracing the muskrat’s homeland and continental Europe as well as a wider source base that extends beyond government records to embrace parliamentary debates, press coverage, and the reports of Bavarian experts that the British government recruited. This approach, the wider spatial setting, and these additional records drive the argument that the muskrat found a new frontier in Britain, where it operated as an unusual kind of creature of empire."
Revisiting the Visiting Teacher: Relearning the Lessons of the Whole-Child Approach,"Drawing on primary documents, we examine the visiting teacher movement (VTM; ca. 1906–40), focusing on three questions: (1) What lessons from the VTM challenge the social and political aims of education in our historical moment? (2) What are lessons for redefining school social work practice today? and (3) What lessons can today’s school social workers use to organize for more expansive views of their practice? We argue the VTM challenged educational bureaucracy by creating blended roles across professions and bridging boundaries between home and school. Although visiting teachers’ work stood in contrast to the factory model of schooling, they had the ear of high-ranking educators across the country. Their vision for the work that was needed, well-organized channels of communication, and networks of support positioned them as a counterweight to contemporaneous views. Their example is a model for reimagining social work, the school space, and the state apparatus."
Ethnic Marginalization and (Non)Compliance in Public Health Emergencies,"Health crises can reveal the inability of governments to induce compliance with policy interventions. While lack of compliance is conventionally attributed to individual mistrust in government, resistance to such interventions is often found clustered among entire communities, particularly in ethnically divided societies. We account for such patterns by explaining how citizens adjust their responses to state authority according to their shared ethnicity with those in power. We assess the effect of ethnicity on citizen compliance with a public health advisory on HIV/AIDS issued by different authority types through a survey-based field experiment in the West African country of Guinea. Members of a politically marginalized ethnic group, the Peul, are significantly less likely to comply with a public health advisory from a national government representative, the president, when compared to local or religious leaders. We show that perceived ethnic discrimination conditions both trust in and compliance with different authority types."
The fetishes of Fernando Ortiz,"A materialistic way to account for the continuities and discontinuities of the extended work of Cuban researcher, writer, and politician Fernando Ortiz, is to follow the trajectory of his fetishes. From the fetishes of Italian and Spanish criminal anthropology, to the national and ethnic libraries and archives, going through tobacco, sugar, and Afro-Cuban drums, and objects—things always have a central place in the thought and writing of the Cuban polygraphist. I will review here some moments of the relationship between Ortiz and his fetishes to understand their ethnographic agencies and their importance to Ortiz’s exploration of Caribbean modernity. My reading will transit from the counter-fetishist politics of Los negros brujos (1906) to the organologic fetishization of Los instrumentos de la música afrocubana (1952–1955), going through the double fetishism of the transculturation of tobacco and sugar in the Contrapunteo cubano del tabaco y el azúcar (1940)."
Foreigners at Beni Hassan: Evidence from the Tomb of Khnumhotep I (No. 14),"The procession of Asiatics in the tomb of Khnumhotep II (No. 3) at Beni Hassan is one of the most famous scenes alluding to ancient Egypt’s interactions with its neighbors. Khnumhotep II, however, was not the only official at Beni Hassan to include representations of foreigners. The tomb of his possible grandfather, Khnumhotep I (No. 14), additionally features unique depictions of a number of individuals who can be identified as of non-Egyptian origin. These foreigners signal that particular cross-cultural relations could remain under the auspices of specific families in the early Middle Kingdom, perhaps influencing power and political dynamics that helped shape the 12th Dynasty. The following presents the most recent recordings of the depictions as completed by The Australian Centre for Egyptology, commenting on their nature and historical significance in relation to Khnumhotep I and the Oryx nome."
The Distributional Impacts of Energy Taxes,"Taxes have long been advocated by economists for efficient pollution control, particularly in the energy sector. However, these taxes may enjoy less political support than standards-based regulation at least partly because of the common assumption that they place a greater burden on the poor than the rich. This article evaluates the validity of that assumption by reviewing the literature on the distributional impacts of energy taxes and by analyzing energy consumption surveys in select countries. The evidence suggests that energy taxes need not be as regressive as is often assumed. We find that the incidence (i.e., distributional impact) of such taxes depends upon the energy commodities that are taxed; the physical, social, and climatic characteristics of the jurisdictions in which they are implemented; and the use of energy tax revenues. We also show that the variation in household energy expenditure is greater within income groups than across income groups and that such variation is not easily reduced."
Colorblind Feminisms: Ansari-Grace and the Limits of #MeToo Counterpublics,"This article focuses on the uproar over the sexual encounter between actor/comedian Aziz Ansari and a woman known publicly as Grace as a lens onto the colorblind counterpublic feminisms driving the #MeToo movement. Tracing the ways that this sexual encounter between a Brown Muslim man and an anonymous, presumably white, woman were spotlighted, we show that race is superficially absent even as it informs the range of feminist counterpublics that emerged around this case. Extending feminist theories of counter/publics, we explore the ways that the hybrid media system, including traditional as well as digital media, enables colorblind feminisms. Focusing on Facebook as an index of these plural feminist perspectives, we examine eighty-four of the most shared links on this platform to show that, regardless of the positions taken, issues of gender and sexuality dominate framings of the Ansari-Grace encounter, even as race and racialization implicitly mediate the public conversations on heterosexual violence and misconduct. Situating these conversations within the broader history of US racisms and the politics of sexual assault, we also point to how mediated technologies are contributing to the hypervisibility of men of color and shaping which cases occupy the limelight and the feminist counterpublics emerging around them. We argue that these colorblind feminist counterpublics, in effect, center the pain of white women."
"Spoken Words, Written Memories: Early Oral History and Elite Interviews","In its early stages, oral history proposed a new technique of knowledge production for the humanities: the interview. Today, oral history is understood as a way of collecting the voices of those people who might otherwise have had no say in the writing of history. In the 1940s and 1950s United States, however, oral history was regarded primarily as a method of giving voice to social and political elites. Most often, those who conducted the interviews did not listen to the sound recordings, which were immediately transcribed by colleagues, research assistants, or secretaries, as a supplement to the written record that could enable a fuller, more comprehensive, and better history. Why, then, conduct interviews—why not simply ask the protagonists to write down their memories? I seek to answer that question by examining one particular project of elite interviewing in the early 1960s, Sources for History of Quantum Physics, initiated by American physicists and carried out by three historians of science, Thomas S. Kuhn, John L. Heilbron, and Paul Forman."
Policing and Symbolic Control: The Process of Valorization,"How do police uphold the status quo and participate in community marginalization? Scholars have answered this by examining instrumental forms of social control (e.g., legal enforcement, punishment, and physical violence). Shifting the gaze, this article develops a framework of symbolic control to explain how the cultural dimensions of policing also operate as implicit, but influential, forms of police power. It draws on fieldwork of a high school junior police academy to show the program’s engagement in valorization, a type of symbolic control that elevated the moral worth of some over others, and how valorization concurrently operated with stigmatization to shape local inequalities, amplify social tensions, and justify police presence. If instrumental social control aims to manage physical order, this article shows how symbolic control legitimizes the social and political order. Beyond policing, this valorization framework can be adapted to analyze processes of power in other contexts."
"The Dipylon Mistress: Social and Economic Complexity, the Gendering of Craft Production, and Early Greek Ceramic Material Culture","This article considers the role of changing contexts of production in the evolution of ceramic material culture in early Greece. Rather than focusing on the aesthetics of ceramics or reading political and social change from patterns in ceramic style and consumption, we consider Early Iron Age (EIA) ceramic style in its context of production. Isolating the idiosyncratic aspects of EIA material culture and evaluating them in dialogue with the ethnographic record, we argue that dynamics of change in EIA ceramic repertoires may be best explained as the result of evolving contexts of production after the Bronze Age collapse that resulted in women having an increased and prominent role in potting and painting vessels. Likewise, stylistic changes occurring in the late eighth and seventh centuries BCE may be related to a transition back to a more complex economic structure in which ceramic style was driven by profit-seeking male potters."
Integrating Natural Capital into National Accounts: Three Decades of Promise and Challenge,"Economists and ecologists have worked for decades on measuring sustainability by supplementing or adjusting traditional economic indicators such as GDP. Given the threats to humanity from climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss, it is vital to incorporate values of natural capital into national economic decision-making. This review focuses on how natural capital applications, historically applied from local to global scales, address national-scale concerns. However, natural capital data and accounts have been only partially developed in most countries, given a lack of common metrics and monetary values. Existing accounts are often incomplete in both the types of natural capital and ecosystems they include (e.g., water, land, different ecosystem types) and the values they measure (e.g., market vs. nonmarket values). While it is important to continue work to embed natural capital into national economic accounts, the need for practical tools to analyze environmental problems is more urgent. We review alternative options for incorporating natural capital into national-scale decision-making and make recommendations for countries where the data, capacity, and political will to conduct formal natural capital accounting are lacking."
"Justice Speaks, but Who’s Listening? Mass Public Awareness of US Supreme Court Cases","We seek to measure the impact of decisions issued by the US Supreme Court on public awareness of its cases. We use a quasi-experimental design with the Court decisions as the stimulus of hypothesized public awareness change. We find that public awareness of cases varies according to individual differences: more educated, knowledgeable, and informationally motivated citizens are more likely to report awareness. Further, decision announcements increase awareness more generally, especially in cases of moderate salience. In contrast, for a very high salience case, awareness is high before and after the decision is announced, while, for a case fabricated by the investigators, “awareness” is not affected by the Court’s activities. The results suggest that while the public may eventually respond to the behavior of national institutions, this response is likely first filtered through an elite subset of the population."
"The Nectar of Life: Fermentation, Soil Health, and Bionativism in Indian Natural Farming","In response to an agrarian crisis, small-scale farmers in South India are experimenting with the application of agricultural ferments to their degraded soils. This article focuses on the Nectar of Life, a fermented preparation made by practitioners of Zero Budget Natural Farming out of the urine and dung of native cows. Based on ethnography in Wayanad, Kerala, and textual analysis of statements by Subhash Palekar, the inventor of the ferment, I unpack its recipe ingredient by ingredient and show that fermenting the Nectar of Life enacts a microbial ontology of agriculture. Through fermentation, natural farmers rethink soil care as a fundamentally relational activity that requires humans, cows, plants, and microorganisms to work together for mutual benefit. However, fermentation and natural farming are also implicated in what I call bionativism, a nativism focused on biological belonging. The native cow as the cornerstone species of probiotic fermentation makes microbial thinking compatible with nativist politics and tropes of the Hindu Right. I analyze the ambivalences of combining probiotic perspectives on more-than-human health with a rejection of alien species. I show how fermentation practices produce not only living soils but also nativist objects such as native cows, native earthworms, and native soils as well as their foreign enemies."
The Technopolitics of Food: The Case of German Prison Food from the Late Eighteenth to the Early Twentieth Centuries,"Since the Annales School started to investigate the history of food in the 1960s, institutional diets have been an important field of research. The history of food encountered the general source problem of the history of everyday life of the lower, often illiterate, classes, as they have left hardly any written sources. Even more, food is highly perishable, so that it leaves nothing as a source itself. In contrast to this, institutions kept books registering the expenses and consumption of food, and can be used to access the history of food. This article presents a different view of institutional food. It shows that prison food does not just mirror the general developments of the food of the people, as the Annalistes had hoped for. Instead, it shows that the dietetic order in prison described and expressed the social, political, and judicial concepts of the day, as well as concepts of the body. In addition, it shows that the dietetic order resulted from multiple negotiations of the various actors involved, including those in law, administration, science, and medicine, and last but not least, the public. Using the example of Prussia, this article investigates changes in prison food standards and cross-checks this with quantitative developments as well as with the personal experiences of prisoners from 1700 to 1914."
Wearing Policy: Uniform Foolishness in the Public School,"In this personal account, the author recounts navigating a school uniform policy as a new teacher in a large public high school in Baltimore. He loosely situates this telling in the recent history of the public school uniform movement, of which Baltimore was central. Writing in an urgent present tense, the author details the many complexities posed by a rigid policy regulating students’ bodies. Unfolding over the course of a single school year, this article charts a system newcomer’s evolving understanding of the uniform policy, a school, and his students. The article additionally raises broader considerations about policy enforcement in classrooms and probes the social and political implications of policies schools prioritize."
"Ethics, morality, and moralizing in anthropological research","In response to papers by Langlitz on the position of the devil’s advocate and Van Dinther on morality and advocacy, I try to parse ethics, morality, and moralizing in light of my two recent studies: of the rehabilitation of child sex molesters, and of the incorporation of Syrian refugees in Germany. I argue against any automatic politicizing or moralizing of our research objects, though this is not a categorical opposition. There are times when the anthropologist is thrust into a political advocacy role, and where avoidance in assuming this role would be unethical. That has indeed been the case for my work with and on refugees. However, ethical research with child sex molesters was possible only by depoliticizing and de-moralizing their location in contemporary culture. To study a subject widely assumed incorrigible and defined as evil, ethnographic research was possible only through empathetic understanding and the ability to situate the subject in a developmental frame to understand how he or she has arrived at the act of child molestation and what the possibilities for change of the self are."
Emergence,"Histories of science in the past decade have increasingly used the language of “emergence” to explain the effects of which their histories give account. More than a linguistic fad, this word registers an intentional, persuasive, and important theoretical position and ethical stance that is located in critical relation to causal accounts of history. Attending to the death of Frantz Fanon (1925–1961) helps make apparent the key criticisms of causal models of history—namely, that they are often reductive, indebted to projects of settler colonialism, and inadequately equipped to address the surfeit of possibilities that historical materials make available to scholars. For historians of science, Karen Barad’s “agential realism” offers the most relevant, if challenging, articulation of emergence theory and relational visions of history. It posits that establishing difference—individuation—is part of the process of “emerging” and that different states or objects continue to be “entangled” even when their distinct contours appear. The approach is appealing because it understands historical scholarship not as a thing of the past but as an ethic of the future—opening worlds of possibility in a political moment that demands better ways of living and dying together."
The Delightfully Scatological Humor of Ali Wong: Cringe Comedy and Neoliberal Maternal Discourse,"This essay grapples with how Asian American women have been increasingly positioned as the idealized maternal subjects of a neoliberal world order. The “tiger mother,” as popularized by Amy Chua, can be considered a recent gendered, racial formation produced in direct opposition to the “Black welfare mother” as a figure of pathological reproductive excess and dependency. Yet this latest twenty-first-century incarnation of model minority discourse can be distinguished by the way it has been mobilized to discipline not only nonwhite populations but also a foundering white majority. I explore the limits and possibilities of comedy for disrupting neoliberal maternal discourse by examining Ali Wong’s Baby Cobra and Hard Knock Wife. Wong responsibly manages fertility, establishing stable career conditions before having her first child at age thirty-three, and performs both comedy specials visibly pregnant, exhibiting the feminine forms of bodily resilience that neoliberalism demands. Yet I demonstrate how Wong subverts neoliberalism’s biopolitics of reproductive respectability by deploying gross, cringeworthy scatological humor. As a genre of comedy defined by the response it elicits from viewers, cringe engenders an uncontrollable bodily contraction that also allows for another kind of inward reflective critical turn to take place. In her stand-up, Wong repeatedly redirects the cringe from the usual individual subject/object of humiliation to the gendered racial power structures that govern motherhood under contemporary neoliberalism. I elaborate how Wong’s cringe humor and aesthetic allow us to theorize a politics and ethics of lying down as a means of critiquing and countering the heightened demands for female labor, especially from women of color, that have become nearly impossible to refuse in today’s relentlessly aspirational neoliberal culture."
From Völkerpsychologie to the Sociology of Knowledge,"This article focuses on two developments in nineteenth-century (philosophy of) social science: Moritz Lazarus’s and Heymann Steinthal’s Völkerpsychologie and Georg Simmel’s early sociology of knowledge. The article defends the following theses. First, Lazarus and Steinthal wavered between a “strong” and a “weak” program for Völkerpsychologie. Ingredients for the strong program included methodological neutrality and symmetry; causal explanation of beliefs based on causal laws; a focus on groups, interests, tradition, culture, or materiality; determinism; and a self-referential model of social institutions. Second, elements of the weak program were the blurring of explanatory and normative interests, an emphasis on freedom of the will, and antirelativism and antimaterialism. Third, later research projects keeping the label “Völkerpsychologie” followed the weak program. Fourth, in the 1880s and 1890s, Simmel tried to build on some of the elements of the strong program. Finally, and fifth, part of the explanation for why Simmel did not succeed in his attempt had to do with the social-political situation of German academia around 1900."
Competence versus Priorities: Negative Electoral Responses to Education Quality in Brazil,"Do voters reward politicians for the quality of public services? We address this question by studying voters’ responses to signals of municipal school quality in Brazil, a setting particularly favorable to electoral accountability. Findings from a regression discontinuity design and a field experiment are strikingly consistent. Contrary to expectations, signals of school quality decrease electoral support for the local incumbent. However, we find the expected effect among citizens for whom school quality should be most salient—parents with children in municipal schools. Using an online survey experiment, we argue that voters who do not value education interpret school quality as an indicator of municipal policy priorities and perceive trade-offs with other services. Voters may hold politicians accountable not only for their competence but also for their representation of potentially conflicting interests—a fact that complicates the simple logic behind many accountability interventions."
Social Entrepreneurship in Social Work: Opportunities for Success,"Objective: Due to the increasing complexity of social problems, social workers need to adopt an innovation and entrepreneurship lens to create innovative long-term solutions for diverse and vulnerable populations. We sought to understand what makes social work entrepreneurs innovative and successful. Method: We conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with 18 social workers in Israel who successfully established social services to tackle social problems in innovative, creative ways. Results: Interaction between the individual and their ability to seize changes in their sociopolitical environment promotes social entrepreneurship. Social workers need to have competencies, skills, and motives to seek out social change. However, these personal characteristics are insufficient in the absence of sociopolitical opportunities, including (a) changes in policymakers’ perceptions regarding ways to deal with social problems, (b) changes among political policy actors or appointment of new key decision-makers, and (c) formative events in the relevant environment. Conclusions: Successful social entrepreneurship in social work depends on competencies, skills, and motives to seek out social change as well as the ability of social workers to identify and seize opportunities in their sociopolitical environment within a specific time frame. We recommend inclusion of social entrepreneurship in social work education, including the development of critical thinking, commitment to change, and identification of opportunities."
Torture without Torturers: Violence and Racialization in Black Chicago,"What happens when trauma becomes a political frame for recognizing anti-black racism and police violence? I grapple with this question by illustrating the ways that survivors of police torture must present themselves as a part of a disability category. More broadly, this article demonstrates that, as opposed to being a category of difference unto itself, the idea of police torture in Chicago has been transformed through legal precedent, activism, and the resulting legislation to emerge, as it has in its latest rendition, as a medical condition. I argue that the role of trauma in producing such categories of disability is not unidirectional. Since racialized debilitation always already informs societal institutions before any contemporary incidence of state violence occurs, these concessions reify a “racial caste system” by putting the onus on the traumatized to gain state recognition. If they do not, then they have no one to blame but themselves. In sum, I show that the problem with trauma as a legal category is that it justifies inequality for black victims of police violence because these concessions betray a tacit assumption that they are debilitated by virtue of their racialized status before they can gain relief through the law."
Reflections on the Knowledge of Shallow Waters,"This essay traces the trajectory of the conceptual and representational history of maritime and riverain littorals across time and space, as discussed in the case studies presented in this Focus section. From late medieval Chinese cartography to modern hydrographical engineering, the piece addresses the diverse contexts in which scientific questions were formulated and problem solutions sought. The chronological progression guides the reader from the premodern cartographic depiction of shallow waters to an early modern European exploration of the life of the littoral to the emergence of modern scientific formulations on an oceanic scale and, finally, to the colonial and postcolonial collisions of science, politics, and law. Arabic sources on traditional Arabic navigation in the Indian Ocean provide examples that add to our knowledge of Chinese and European hydrographic concepts and practices."
Compounding Greekness: St. Katherine “the Egyptian” and the Sta. Croce Micromosaic,"This article is the first critical study of a small panel painting of St. Katherine of Alexandria, discovered sixty years ago on the reverse of the well-known micromosaic icon of the Man of Sorrows at Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome. Proceeding from close visual and material analyses, supplemented by unpublished conservation photographs, the article calls into question the original identity of the figure represented, revealing the extent to which it was adapted on the panel’s journey through the Mediterranean between Byzantium and Rome. The article spotlights the southern Italian leg of that journey. It was in Apulia, in an act of repurposing and rededication, that the unknown original figure depicted on the panel was transformed into Katherine of Alexandria and that this transformed image was joined with the micromosaic Man of Sorrows to form one bifacial icon. In elaborating on the implications of this rededication, the article revises the theory of the double-sided icon’s patronage in Italy, connecting it instead to major political figures in Angevin Naples. Beyond new historical details, research into the adventure of the bifacial Sta. Croce icon affords fresh insight into how such foreign objects were received in the Latin West ca. 1400. While the micromosaic side of the icon is best known for its associations with the Mass of St. Gregory, a legend that pegged the micromosaic’s origins to Rome, its fusion with St. Katherine speaks to a now-eclipsed origin tradition for the icon, one that underscored a provenance in the Greek East, specifically Egypt, the epicenter of Katherine’s cult. Katherine’s unconventional costume, the style in which she was depicted, the inclusion of Greek epigraphy, and the distinctive punchwork ornamentation of the gold ground all contributed to this conceit, which indicates a desire to emulate the requisite terms of dedication customary in the Christian East."
Introduction,"This article serves as the framework for the forum on the history of libraries, presented at the Making of the Humanities conference in Somerville College, the University of Oxford, in September 2017. The article offers an overview of the development of books and libraries, primarily in the Western world, with emphasis on the physical book—including the supports on which texts are written—within the library. The library as a locus of scholarly communication with present and past authors and its cataloguing and delivery systems are discussed. The conclusion returns to the role of the library as related to questions of ephemerality and the preservation of knowledge. The three contributing papers and one section of the introductory paper provide examples from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries of humanistic and ecclesiastical-humanistic Italian libraries and their intellectual, social, and political milieux; sources of patronage; and roles in the intellectual life of their times."
Leaky Revelations: Commitments in Exposing Militarism,"Contests over the control of information are central to the perpetuation and critique of militarism. This article examines one of the most prominent sets of state document leaks in recent political history: the online posting of hundreds of thousands of US war logs and diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks. Bold statements were advanced in 2010 and afterward regarding what these releases made visible. In contrast, this article considers how disclosure and nondisclosure came bundled together. With reference to the tensions of keeping secrets and producing transparency, I suggest that the promise attached to the released documents did not just derive from the argument that they revealed modern statecraft, nor that such knowledge was tantalizingly out of reach, but from the manner in which what had been rendered knowable could be revisited over time. Through this argument I want to explore the affective knots, conceptual tangles, and problematic story lines associated with exposing militarism."
"Destroying the negatives: M. N. Srinivas, fire, and photography","M. N. Srinivas’s The remembered village bristles with references to photography, from a formal group image of villagers marking Gandhi’s death to an account of villagers’ enthusiasm for the products of Srinivas’s own camera. We learn, among other things, that Srinivas became known as the “chamara man,” that he photographed the castration of bulls, that some of his photographs were almost involved in a court case, and that a Dalit worker resisted the ethnographer’s camera because the police used photographs to trace runaway servants. This article examines his recounting of the role of the camera in Rampura, and the relationship of photography to memory, evidence, and politics, before moving to a very different village in central India whose recent and current fixation with the camera, and what it makes visible and permanent, is explored."
"Brightening Biochemistry: Humor, Identity, and Scientific Work at the Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry, 1923–1931","In the 1920s, scientists at the University of Cambridge’s Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry made major contributions to the emerging discipline of biochemistry while also devoting considerable time and energy to the production of a humor journal entitled Brighter Biochemistry. Although humor is frequently regarded as peripheral to the work of science, the journal provides an opportunity to understand how it contributes to the social infrastructure of scientific communities as modern workplaces. Taking methodological cues from cultural history, ethnography, and humor studies, this essay conducts a close and contextual reading of Brighter Biochemistry. This reading demonstrates how humor served as a central means through which members of the Dunn confronted workplace issues, including creating cooperative work teams, responding to gender discrimination, addressing funding anxiety, and defining professional identity. These conclusions provide a new perspective on the well-documented history of the Dunn and also offer a model for how historians of science can approach humor when its traces are encountered in other settings."
In the Long Run: Ugandans Living with Disability,"Uganda has progressive legislation in place to support the rights of people with disabilities, and it has received donor support over the years for special education and community-based rehabilitation programs. Yet while political mobilization and interventions that aim to minimize disabling conditions have been important, they are not necessarily seen as a means to achieving rights and self-sufficiency. Using examples of families I have known for decades, I show how disability interventions and institutions affect their lives in the long run. James Ferguson’s approach to relations of dependence is useful in understanding how people in eastern Uganda perceive the possibilities in disability projects. I contrast global health time as instantiated in such projects with lifetimes of people and families with disabilities. Humanitarian and development projects sometimes feed into life projects such as education, housing, livelihood, and making families. But their impact is often not so great in the long run of lifetimes intertwined with lives of intimate others."
The Geography of Rape: Shaming Narratives in Norwegian Rape Cases,"This article discusses how perpetrators and victims are constructed in legal rape cases and how these constructions are informed by notions of gender, sexuality, race, and nation. It presents an in-depth frame analysis of two legal cases that were processed by Norwegian appellate courts in 2012. In so doing, I show how the allocation of shame and sympathy for victims and perpetrators is connected to citizenship through gender and race discrimination. The analysis suggests that whereas the perpetrator with a majority racial background was subject to so-called reintegrative shaming, the perpetrator with a minority racial background was subject to stigmatic shaming. The politics of shame in the context of rape thus manifests as an attribution of guilt (but to a lesser extent shame and stigmatization) to the majority perpetrator, whereas the minority perpetrator was constructed as a deviant outlaw deserving of public shame. Prior relationship with the perpetrator, sexually “risk-taking” behavior, and alcohol consumption were associated with negative stereotyping of victims. Moreover, the court regarded violence committed by the perpetrator from a racial-majority group as a deviation from the civilized and gender-equal mainstream culture. I therefore argue that geography constitutes a specific element in the legal processing of rape cases. With the prosecution of rape as a medium, the courts produce and reproduce a moral community in which some sexual citizens are admitted a share and others are not, while the legal process simultaneously manages the sexual rights of citizens in different physical and social spaces."
The Role of Diet in Resilience and Vulnerability to Climate Change among Early Agricultural Communities in the Maya Lowlands,"The Terminal Classic Period (AD 750–1000) collapse of lowland Maya social, economic, and political systems has been temporally correlated with severe and extended drought in regional paleoclimate records. Ancient Maya society also experienced a protracted multicentury drought earlier during the end of the Late Preclassic Period (AD 100–300). While some large Preclassic polities declined, many more flourished through the Early Classic. Why were the effects of the Terminal Classic drought more dramatic? What allowed some earlier Maya communities to be more resilient in the face of climate change? Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human skeletal remains from 50 individuals at the ancient Maya community of Cahal Pech from this critical time period suggest that more diverse diets may have promoted resilience in the face of changing socioecological systems at the end of the Preclassic. During the Late Classic Period (AD 600–800), isotopic data indicate that high-status individuals had a narrow and highly specialized diet, which may have created a more vulnerable socioeconomic system that ultimately disintegrated as a result of anthropogenic landscape degradation and severe drought conditions during the Terminal Classic."
“The Thirteenth Century Men”: Looking to the Past to Critique the Present,"Admirers of John Ruskin founded the Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, a short-lived but influential art and political reform movement active from 1863 to 1865. With a stated mission promulgated by a house organ called the New Path, the group’s artists, architects and critics claimed to constitute an art movement. They were bound by formal membership, and all espoused dedication to Ruskin’s medievalism and credo of “truth to nature.”This commitment earned the artists recognition as American Pre-Raphaelites. Their paintings were touted by the New Path as vibrant agents of reform yet were also negatively critiqued for rejecting post-Renaissance illusionism, embracing instead seemingly retrogressive models found in the early Italian paintings. Two collections of early Italian paintings were also on view in New York during the 1860s. These received largely negative popular reception, a response extended to the paintings of the American Pre-Raphaelites. Ironically, these collections introduced American audiences to the early history of Western European painting, ultimately introducing the discipline of art history in the United States."
"The Project ArAGATS Kasakh Valley Archaeological Survey, Armenia: Report of the 2014–2017 Seasons","During four field seasons spanning 2014 through 2017, Project ArAGATS (Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies) expanded our long-term research on the origins and development of complex political systems in the South Caucasus with a comprehensive study of the upper Kasakh River valley in north-central Armenia. The Kasakh Valley Archaeological Survey employed both systematic transect survey of 43 km2 and extensive satellite- and drone-based reconnaissance to accommodate the complex topography of the Lesser Caucasus and the impacts of Soviet-era land amelioration. Though our survey was animated by questions related to the chronology and distribution of Bronze and Iron Age fortifications and cemeteries, we also recorded Paleolithic sites stretching back to the earliest human settlement of the Caucasus, Early Bronze Age surface finds, and historic landscape modifications. Concurrent to the survey, members of the ArAGATS team carried out test excavations at select settlement sites and associated burials, and a series of wetland core extractions, with the goals of affirming site occupation sequences and setting them within their environmental context. This report provides an overview of the results of these multidisciplinary activities.1"
An Imagined Past? Nomadic Narratives in Central Asian Archaeology,"Nomads, or highly specialized mobile pastoralists, are prominent features in Central Asian archaeology, and they are often depicted in direct conflict with neighboring sedentary peoples. However, new archaeological findings are showing that the people who many scholars have called nomads engaged in a mixed economic system of farming and herding. Additionally, not all of these peoples were as mobile as previously assumed, and current data suggest that a portion of these purported mobile populations remained sedentary for much or all of the year, with localized ecological factors directing economic choices. In this article, we pull together nine complementary lines of evidence from the second through the first millennia BC to illustrate that in eastern Central Asia, a complex economy existed. While many scholars working in Eurasian archaeology now acknowledge how dynamic paleoeconomies were, broader arguments are still tied into assumptions regarding specialized economies. The formation of empires or polities, changes in social orders, greater political hierarchy, craft specialization—notably, advanced metallurgy—mobility and migration, social relations, and exchange have all been central to the often circular arguments made concerning so-called nomads in ancient Central Asia. The new interpretations of mixed and complex economies more effectively situate Central Asia into a broader global study of food production and social complexity."
"The Colonized Semites and the Infectious Disease: Theorizing and Narrativizing Anti-Semitism in the Levant, 1870–1914","This article studies the ways in which Arab intellectuals in Egypt and the Levant wrote about modern anti-Semitism during the four decades preceding the demise of the Ottoman Empire. This period is often described as the era of the Arab Nahda (revival); it refers to an era when Arab thinkers and writers showed great interest in the Arabic language, Islamic history, and Arab culture and consumed European literary and philosophical works. Arab intellectuals in this period wrote about Jewish affairs. They protested the persecution of Jews in Eastern and Western Europe and compared anti-Jewish racism to an infectious disease that spread in Europe’s cities and destroyed the fabric of its democracy, especially during the Dreyfus affair. I argue that these very pro-Jewish positions were connected to several conversations about the Arab self. Since the Arabs were categorized as Semites in European racial discourses, the meanings ascribed to the term were of utmost important to them. Arab writers also connected their discussions of anti-Semitism to their broader interest in science; as anti-Semitism seemed to have reflected a remnant from the medieval past, Arab writers wondered why this phenomenon prevailed in modern and scientific Europe. As Ottoman subjects witnessing the colonization of Egypt and North Africa, Arab intellectuals underscored the fact that Europe, whose intellectuals and politicians critiqued the persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire and argued that their colonization brought justice to persecuted minorities, was treating its minorities in a horrific fashion. Lastly, as Arab thinkers demanded linguistic and cultural rights within the Ottoman Empire and demanded to curb the powers of autocratic rulers, they were interested in Europe’s most glaring failed emancipation. Their reflections, moreover, could help us theorize the present moment, when Jews and Muslims struggle together against purist and racist movements in the US and in Europe."
Shifting Networks and Community Identity at Tell Tayinat in the Iron I (ca. 12th to Mid 10th Century B.C.E.),"The end of the 13th and beginning of the 12th centuries B.C.E. witnessed the demise of the great territorial states of the Bronze Age and, with them, the collapse of the extensive                     interregional trade networks that fueled their wealth and power. The period that follows has historically been characterized as an era of cultural devolution marked by profound                     social and political disruption. This report presents the preliminary results of the Tayinat Archaeological Project (TAP) investigations of Iron I (ca. 12th to mid 10th century                     B.C.E.) contexts at Tell Tayinat, which would emerge from this putative Dark Age as Kunulua, royal capital of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Palastin/Patina/Unqi. In contrast to the                     prevailing view, the results of the TAP investigations at Early Iron Age Tayinat reveal an affluent community actively interacting with a wide spectrum of regions throughout the                     eastern Mediterranean. The evidence from Tayinat also highlights the distinctively local, regional character of its cultural development and the need for a more nuanced treatment                     of the considerable regional variability evident in the eastern Mediterranean during this formative period, a treatment that recognizes the diversity of relational networks,                     communities, and cultural identities being forged in the generation of a new social and economic order."
The Unique Role of Anger among Negative Emotions in Goal-Directed Decision Making,"While much of consumer choice is goal driven, consumers often fail to prioritize their goals when making decisions. Despite this relevance of goal pursuit to consumer behavior, relatively little work has examined the factors that facilitate it. The current research examines when and how different negative emotions influence such goal-directed decision making. Six studies show that anger leads to greater goal-directed decision making and more goal-consistent choices compared to sadness and fear. Consequently, anger results in both less susceptibility to contextual choice biases and greater post-choice satisfaction. We argue that the results arise because anger is characterized by appraisals of both high certainty and high control, which increase the likelihood that consumers will use goals as decision criteria. With anger becoming more common in the consumer space, thanks to contemporary social media and political polarization, we provide a framework for marketers and managers to put this negative emotion to good use."
Abortion and the Environment: China’s One-Child Policy in Mo Yan’s Frog and Ma Jian’s The Dark Road,"Despite the immediate threat to human survival posed by climate change, population remains a contentious topic for feminists and environmentalists alike. The most effective way to lower the birth rate is to improve the reproductive health and autonomy of women, but the resurgence of the global religious Right threatens progress, deploying abortion as a political lever in an attempt to erode women’s reproductive rights worldwide, and there is disagreement among environmentalists about appropriate remedies. For most, however, China’s recently relaxed one-child policy is cited as an indefensible violation of women’s human rights. Two high-profile Chinese novels, Mo Yan’s Frog (2009) and Ma Jian’s The Dark Road (2012), condemn the one-child policy by focusing on coerced late-term abortions. In the Chinese context, their dissent reads as subversive, but their defense of women’s freedom to reproduce paradoxically replicates the American antiabortion discourse of regret, guilt, and atonement, which seeks to curtail women’s freedom not to reproduce, both at home and abroad. The enthusiastic reception of these novels by the transnational antichoice constituency shows how literary works that migrate globally through the unstable medium of translation may produce unexpected and disturbing ideological conjunctions."
How Autocrats Manipulate Economic News: Evidence from Russia’s State-Controlled Television,"Conventional wisdom says that autocrats manipulate news through censorship. But when it comes to economic affairs—a highly sensitive topic for modern autocrats—the government’s ability to censor information effectively is limited, because citizens can benchmark the official news against their incomes, market prices, and other observables. We propose that instead of censoring economic facts, the media tactically frames those facts to make the government appear as a competent manager. Using a corpus of daily news reports from Russia’s largest state-owned television network, we document extensive evidence supporting this prediction. Bad news is not censored, but it is systematically blamed on external factors, whereas good news is systematically attributed to domestic politicians. Such selective attribution is used more intensely in politically sensitive times (elections and protests) and when the leadership is already enjoying high popular support—consistent with the existing theories of information manipulation."
From Transcript to “Trans-Script”: Romanized Santali across Semiotic Media,"Santali is an Austro-Asiatic language spoken throughout eastern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. It is currently written in multiple scripts, including a Roman script devised by missionaries in the late nineteenth century, various Indic scripts, and an independently derived script, Ol-Chiki. Each of these script systems entails different sound-to-script relationships, especially for phones such as the word-final glottalized consonants, which are not present in the dominant Indo-European vernaculars. This article traces the historical transformations of sound-to-script relations in the various scripts of Santali and tracks in particular a Romanized Santali transcription orthography that developed as a way to mediate between different scripts. The Romanized Santali form assumed a particular importance as Santali speakers started using Santali in digital and online spaces due to software limitations. However, the differing use of variants within the script to represent sounds such as word-final glottal consonants shows that what appears to be a novel orthography is in fact a “trans-script,” rhematizing the historical and ideological trajectories of the various script systems already in use in nondigital domains. The article claims that the Romanized “trans-script,” though internally diverse, has been deployed to further the standardization project and cultural politics associated with the Ol-Chiki script."
Toward Progressive Narratives of American Identity,"Donald Trump is one of many leaders who have come to power in recent years championing right-wing nationalisms often called populist. He has done so by advancing an “America First” vision of U.S. history, identity, and purpose that many find compelling. Liberals and progressives in America and elsewhere have failed to counter with politically resonant narratives of national identity that champion greater and more egalitarian inclusiveness. This article offers three criteria for devising such narratives: resonance, respectfulness, and reticulation. It also contends that America’s democratic traditions, its constitutional traditions aimed at achieving a more perfect union without effacing legitimate diversity, and its quest to realize the goals of the Declaration of Independence over time all provide rich resources for stories of American peoplehood that can meet these criteria and, perhaps, defeat narrower nationalist visions."
Nomads Trading with Empires: Intercultural Trade in Ancient Somaliland in the First to Seventh Centuries CE,"This article presents new data from fieldwork in the de facto state of Somaliland, a region in the Horn of Africa historically inhabited by nomadic pastoralists who played a key role in commercial exchange from the first century BCE onward. Relations between ancient empires and nomadic populations have received comparatively little attention in relation to other groups living within or outside imperial boundaries. Our understanding of these interactions has been colored by stereotypes from classical authors and the elusive nature of their archaeological record. It is thus not surprising that the role of nomadic groups in long-distance trade networks in antiquity has been often downplayed. This is the case in the Western Indian Ocean region. Archaeological evidence from survey and excavation work conducted between 2018 and 2020 in Xiis and the Berbera area reveals the strong integration of the region in the Indian Ocean network, the high purchasing power of the nomads, and their heterogeneity. Participation in long-distance trade seems to have provoked important social changes in local communities that did not, however, put them on the path to sedentism and political centralization.1"
Pottery Traditions in Northeastern Crete After the Fall of the Minoan Palatial Systems: A Petrographic Approach at Malia and Sissi,"Separated by less than 4 km and set in a strategic position about 25 km east of Knossos on the northern coast of Crete, the Bronze Age settlements of Sissi and Malia have produced                     extensive archaeological evidence of a prosperous occupation and an important regional role during the last 250 years of their history. The volume, diversity, and quality of the                     ceramic finds reflect the diversity of social contexts of pottery consumption and wealthy trade connections during a period of critical transformations in the political                     organization of Crete. Through petrographic analysis of 218 ceramic samples, this article explores technological choices, local and regional types of production, and pottery import                     networks in the Malia region during the Final Palatial period of centralized administration at Knossos (Late Minoan II–IIIA2 [early], ca. 1460–1370 B.C.E.) and at Malia during the                     ensuing Postpalatial period of regional organization of Crete (Late Minoan IIIA2/B–IIIB, ca. 1370–1190 B.C.E.). The results indicate that north-central Crete played an important                     role as a producer and supplier of pottery under the Knossian rule. Some strictly local pottery traditions developed at Sissi and Malia toward Late Minoan IIIA2 and continued into                     the Postpalatial period, leading to a complex alliance of new and old Minoan traditions."
Policy Brief—The Need for More (Not Less) External Review of Economic Analysis at the U.S. EPA,"Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made significant changes to the way it conducts economic analyses of regulatory actions. Changes in the assumptions and methods used in regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) have produced fundamentally different conclusions about the economic benefits and costs of significant regulations. At the same time, the EPA has eliminated its Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (EEAC), which had provided external review of key inputs to the agency’s benefit–cost analyses, such as the value of a statistical life. This article describes the history and activities of the EEAC to increase understanding of the role it served and what has been lost by eliminating it. In addition, we discuss our own experience as recent EEAC members. We also present examples of the very different results produced by the Obama and Trump administrations’ economic analyses of the same EPA rules to illustrate why external review is so important for ensuring that economic analyses are credible, robust, and not influenced by political agendas."
Can Institutions Make Voters Care about Corruption?,"Voters’ punishment of corrupt politicians at the ballot box is oftentimes modest, at best. Recent studies suggest that this minor electoral sanctioning is due to limited corruption information and to the relative weakness of integrity considerations in voting behavior. We demonstrate that anticorruption measures taken by elite institutions—in this case, the Israeli Supreme Court—in close proximity to an election can increase electoral sanctioning by enhancing the importance of integrity considerations, holding corruption information fixed. We use the variation in incumbent integrity across time and space to identify the effect of an exogenous anticorruption decision by the Supreme Court on voting (study 1). We further test this effect in a novel survey experiment, with mayoral performance satisfaction as the dependent variable (study 2). Both studies demonstrate that judicial bodies have the capacity to influence electoral behavior by enhancing the importance of integrity considerations, holding corruption information constant."
"Between Same-Sex Marriage, Convivencia, and Polyamory: A New Cartography of Queer Relationships in Mexico City","Ethnographic studies on same-sex sexuality in Mexico and Latin America have predominantly paid attention to gendered and sexual subject formation, offering a critique of Western narratives on sexual object choice. Less attention, though, has been paid to subjects’ relations, which have been central to queer politics in Mexico City since 2000 through public debates on Sociedades de Convivencia, same-sex marriage, and polyamory. This article investigates the transformation of intimacy in the lives of women as sexual citizenship is being redefined in Mexico. I suggest that women participating in queer spaces negotiate new cartographies of intimate relationships, in which new terms inscribing the terrain, such as marriage, convivencia, and polyamory, circulate. In the process, individuals negotiate these new relationships not only with their partner(s) but also with their communities, transnational discourses, and the state. This article draws on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken since 2009, including forty interviews with women (cisgender and two trans) taking part in lesbian spaces, participant observation, and a review of newspapers of record. The article investigates how women in Mexico City are negotiating new cartographies of intimate relationships and questioning heteronormativity and mononormativity in the process."
"Oil-Fueled Accumulation in Late Capitalism: Energy, Uneven Development, and Climate Crisis","Capitalist development since the 1940s has been fueled by global oil extraction. Cheap oil was the core energy input in the post–World War II expansion. By the 1970s, the limits of this oil-fueled accumulation regime began to appear. During that decade, a series of oil price hikes combined with other sources of tension to form a deep accumulation crisis. The crisis of the 1970s showed the effects that a strategic circulating capital—in this case, petroleum—has in shaping profitability trends. Today, the possible recessionary effects caused by oil price hikes are joined on the environmental side by another problem: the continued burning of fossil fuels exacerbates the climate crisis. To address this double contradiction, I revisit the Marxian theory of crisis in a world-historical and world-ecological framework. With this framework, I unpack the historical connections between petroleum, uneven development, accumulation crises, and climate change."
"Armed with a Camera: Gender, Human Rights, and Visual Documentation in Israel/Palestine","This article offers an explanation for the use of the documenter’s gender as part of human rights politics. I examine the case of the Camera Project of B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization working in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The organization, which distributes video cameras to Palestinian residents, celebrates the participation of women in the documenting project and declares that the women’s videos capture a unique point of view. In the article I question why the gender of a given witness would be emphasized as essential since there is no clear distinction in the visual outcome—that is, in the videos—between those taken by female and male photographers. I analyze visual material from the project and combine this examination with interviews with Palestinian women photographers, all of which reveals that their gender identity is not crucial to the message that the videos try to impart about Israel’s occupation. Drawing on critical feminist scholarship on the gendering of warfare and international law, I argue that preexisting cultural ideas about gender affect the organization’s strategic framing process."
"Activism, Anthropology, and Disability Studies in Times of Austerity: In Collaboration with Sini Diallo","How can we practice an “anthropology of disability” that is in respectful alliance with the disabled people and disability groups we study? What does critical theory making look like within the politics of such collaborative practice? What valued expertise do anthropologists offer and what do anthropologists gain? In an age of austerity and precarity in academia and in general, disabled people and disability groups struggle for survival while secure funding for grants and programs supporting graduate students and emerging scholars is increasingly precarious. In what interdependent spaces is it possible to imagine disabled activists and scholars working together for survival into an uncertain future? These questions stand at the heart of this collaborative auto-ethnographic essay."
The Code of Pangolins: Interspecies Ethics in the Face of SARS-CoV-2,"More than two decades ago, Lévi-Strauss argued that bovine spongiform encephalopathy was the result of forced cannibalism among cattle. He pointed out that not only the consumption of cattle organs by cattle but also the eating of beef by humans is a kind of cannibalism among animals. His argument highlighted the negative aspects of connection and assimilation in the act of eating. Today, several anthropological responses have been evoked to address the social, (bio)political, and economic problems caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although this article is part of that wider corpus, it focuses not on the novel aspects of the phenomenon but on relatively familiar aspects using “classic” anthropological ideas such as substance code, dividual personhood, and taboo. By comparing the circulation of viruses within and beyond species boundaries with the circulation of substance codes observed in South Asian societies, I point out the imaginariness not of dividual personhood but of our existence as individuals. These examinations raise the significance of the anthropological understanding of people’s practices regarding boundary making and unmaking between the human and the wild to consider the problem of zoonoses originating from wild animals."
"Surveillance by Another Name: The Modern Slavery Act, Global Factory Workers, and Part-Time Sex Work in Sri Lanka","The intensified global movement against human trafficking saw the UK Government pass the Modern Slavery Act in 2015. Article 54 of the act specifically requires British companies to eradicate forced labor within their global supply chains. This essay investigates how the Modern Slavery Act affects workers at the ground level, specifically in Sri Lanka. It highlights how the onus of cleaning up supply chains was outsourced to local factory managers, who in turn placed the responsibility on workers’ shoulders, and how these developments impact a particular gray space that workers sometimes manipulate to engage in part-time sex work. The stigma surrounding factory work in some areas results in migrant workers being branded whores, and the resulting gray space is what part-time sex workers manipulate to manage their reputations. By investigating how workers play with identities and labels, this article analyzes how women navigate neoliberal aspirations and precarious, underpaid labor within competing local discourses. In doing so, the essay theorizes how gray spaces—such as the ones factory workers navigate—contain the potential for subversive politics, agency, and empowerment and how global legal narratives impinge on such spaces of play and thereby reenact old colonial power circuits even as they contribute to the imperialist character of globalized culture and policies. The essay contributes to an emerging literature on global citizen activism and highlights how resultant policies and practices may endanger complex, context-specific socioeconomic and cultural arrangements."
Hot Town: Sensing Heat in Summertime Manhattan,"This essay examines visual records to reveal summer heat’s effect on the body, on living spaces, and on Manhattan’s cityscape due to the urban heat island, the phenomenon of significantly warmer temperatures in metropolitan areas due to concentrated development and human activities. Although the bodily experience of heat and humidity is intimate and subjective, summer temperatures, especially when amplified by a heat wave, fostered collective seasonal suffering in the pre-“climate-controlled” city. This essay analyzes a political cartoon, news photography, and the work of three artists associated with American realism and the Ashcan School of art. While urban historians have long recognized the environment in cities, their studies have focused on physical places such as parks rather than on more elusive categories of nature such as weather and climate. A history of urbanites’ sensory experience of heat-as-environment therefore waits to be told. The interaction of weather with New York’s pavement, brick, and stone created a summer heatscape; visual archives of this phenomenon foreground the materiality of both the body and the urban environment. They make visible the seasonal feeling of, and environmental challenges inherent to, Manhattan’s dense tenement districts."
Civil Service and Patronage in Bureaucracies,"How do politicians staff the bureaucracy and what are the policy implications? We develop a dynamic model of personnel policy, bureaucratic quality, and electoral competition. In each period, incumbents choose how much to support patronage and civil service personnel systems. The civil service system is needed to produce public goods, but patronage provides private goods and improves an incumbent’s reelection prospects. Incumbents must also worry about whether opponents will sustain the civil service system following an electoral loss. Our results demonstrate the importance of a cross-party commitment to public goods, along with low costs of civil service hiring, for encouraging good government in equilibrium. The model also suggests that electoral competitiveness has only a limited influence on good government and challenges previous arguments about electoral vulnerability and civil service reform. We finally present empirical evidence regarding our predicted relationship between party system convergence and merit-based hiring."
“Smart Power” in Standards Implementation after No Child Left Behind,"Purpose: As the federal government has retreated from taking a dominant role in encouraging implementation of common K–12 standards, states and districts have moved to fill this education policy vacuum. This study aims to understand how state and district leaders are navigating this new policy environment. Research Methods/Approach: Drawing upon 47 interviews with state and district administrators conducted in 2016 and 2017, we used deductive coding based on a policy attributes theory to examine the co-occurrence of codes for specificity, consistency, authority, power, and stability. Throughout this process, we assessed interrater reliability through paired coding, research team discussions, and recoding to uncover broad themes. Findings: We identify the concept of “smart power” as a ubiquitous mechanism that leaders are utilizing to balance buy-in (authority) and accountability (power). We find that this balance remains precarious and highly dependent upon local political contexts. Smart power can allow for more thoughtful and sustainable implementation strategies that increase teacher support for these policies—or it can become a rhetorical device without substantive change. Implications: We reveal the enduring appeal of accountability policies even when administrators express reservations about falling back on the legacy of No Child Left Behind. These findings hold broad relevance for the implementation of K–12 standards moving forward, particularly as states consider how to build legitimacy and buy-in toward new and revised standards-based policies in the wake of the pandemic."
Tax Equivalences and Their Implications,"In economic analyses of the effects of tax policies, one commonly encounters discussions of the equivalence of apparently different policies, where “equivalence” is defined as the policies having the same impact on fundamental economic outcomes. These related tax policies may differ in many respects, including (1) the side of a market on which they are applied, (2) the form in which they are imposed (e.g., as a unit or ad valorem tax, on a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive basis, etc.), (3) whether they are imposed on households or firms, (4) the market in which they are directly imposed, (5) their timing, and (6) whether behavioral adjustments are involved in the equivalence. These differences give rise to conditions under which the equivalences may break down, because of several factors, including (1) differences in salience; (2) market imperfections, such as liquidity constraints, price rigidity or imperfect competition; (3) differences in information requirements and the costs of tax administration and enforcement; and (4) government accounting rules. This paper draws out the key issues that relate to tax equivalences, using several illustrations from important instances of such equivalences that span different areas of taxation, with many of these illustrations relating to the taxation of capital income. Recognition of equivalences and the ways in which they may fail to hold is important both for positive analysis (e.g., the political reasons for choosing one approach over another) and for normative analysis (to determine which approach may be a more effective way of implementing a policy)."
The Millennial Gap in Dome Construction in Rome,"Though Rome has a long history of domed constructions, not one dome was built in that city during a one-thousand-year period—roughly between the mid-fifth and the mid-fifteenth century. How can we explain such a gap and what is implied by this absence? This paper begins by asking why dome construction in Rome stopped after the mid-fifth century. Typological, political, ideological, and possibly technical reasons lie at the root of this rupture, which itself urges a reevaluation of the significance and function of domes across time, and of the cultural context that allowed for their demise. A second question is then posed about why Romans were slow to return to dome construction after the form blossomed elsewhere on the Italian peninsula between the eleventh and early fifteenth centuries. This delayed reappearance discloses distinct attitudes toward domes and suggests Romans lacked the desire to build them; indeed, they were quite content with the alternative solutions they had developed in the intervening centuries, chief among which were thin-walled basilicas and their mosaic-encrusted half-dome apses. All told, Rome’s millennial gap in dome construction invites us to reconsider longstanding historiographical assumptions about medieval architecture."
"Rhythms of Catastrophe, Iterations of Inequity: Disaster Memory, Dislocation, and Disparity during Pelée’s Eruption of 1929","AbstractMount Pelée, the volcano on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, dramatically erupted in 1902, instantaneously killing thirty thousand people and obliterating the town of Saint-Pierre. With the deadliest eruption in the Western hemisphere, Pelée became the stuff of legends, making its way into postcards and literature the world over before falling silent for almost three decades. A generation later, the volcano erupted once more, this time spreading its effects over three years rather than a few fateful seconds. Historical memory played a pivotal role in the public, scientific, and governmental response to the eruption of 1929, as the rhythms of the environment ran up against human civilization. Greatly overshadowed in both the historiography and popular imagination by the eruption of 1902, the eruption of 1929 underscores the key role played by “disaster memory” in shaping the response to natural disasters. On the one hand, French officials drew on the lessons of the 1902 eruption in ways that helped to ensure the safety of Martinique’s colonial citizens. On the other hand, however, they replicated past approaches to disaster relief that further entrenched the economic disparities and sociopolitical inequities that characterized the colonial world."
Protecting Perishable Values: Timescapes of Moving Fermented Foods across Oceans and International Borders,"Although it is popular to credit microbes as metabolic “laborers” responsible for producing the distinctive flavors and preservative properties of raw milk cheeses, cured meats, and assorted ferments, the fermentation value of foods can be put at risk by the material conditions and regulatory politics of international trade. Transportation and distribution are therefore today considered an aspect of and not something that follows production and value formation. Drawing on preliminary research with specialty importers, consolidators, and brokers, this article traces the work of moving fermented foods across oceans and borders, highlighting how the timescapes and transformations associated with mobility and perishability interact in ways that might erode product value but that can also successfully be navigated by retailers and their suppliers through skillful logistical and semiotic practices."
"Who’s at the Party? Group Sentiments, Knowledge, and Partisan Identity","In studying US partisanship, scholars often invoke a groups approach, wherein individuals’ group memberships affect their identification with the Democratic and Republican Parties. While this literature implies that partisanship stems from citizens’ sentiments toward the groups that constitute the parties’ membership, this particular proposition has not been thoroughly investigated. We, in turn, propose a group sentiments model of partisanship—a subtheory of the groups approach—wherein citizens harbor feelings toward many social groups and have reasonably accurate knowledge about how such groups align with the parties. When these factors are combined, the direction and strength of citizens’ partisanship are altered. Using cross-sectional and experimental data, we show that citizens’ sentiments toward politically aligned groups shape their partisanship irrespective of their own group memberships, revealing the importance of sentiments toward social in-groups and out-groups. Thus, apart from containing “people like me,” citizens also care about which party contains “people I like.”"
Louis Lomax’s Relationship with Malcolm X and Its Role in the Evolution of the Nation of Islam’s Popularity and Lomax’s Philosophy,"After explaining the basic tenets of the Potsdam theory of functional-communicative linguistics, firmly rooted in the German Democratic Republic (1949–90), this article discusses the ‘forgetting processes’ that consigned this theory to oblivion. Profiting from the uniformity of the system of general education in the GDR, the Potsdam school had a considerable influence on textbook production. The paradigm associated with it, however, was never really accepted by the universities nor by Academia at large, which thus led to its isolation from national and international academic discourse. Additionally, a paradigm that is imposed tends to be forgotten easily when its imposer disappears. After German reunification, therefore, the Potsdam school’s sudden loss of institutional basis marked the definite demise of the paradigm. To better understand this instance of scholarly forgetting, the article will survey a wide range of ideological, political, institutional and personal factors that contributed considerably to the Vergessenspotential of the Potsdam school’s functional-communicative approach. Apart from considering such external factors, it will also argue that reasons for its falling into oblivion can be found in the erroneous premises of the theory itself. The article will conclude by demonstrating how even the negative results of the Potsdam paradigm have meanwhile been forgotten to such a degree that it has even become possible, in present-day scholarship, to repeat its errors. As such, this article also presents a case study of how the forgetting of unsuccessful paradigms can in some cases actually hamper scholarly progress."
The Functional-Communicative Approach to Language of the Potsdam School in the German Democratic Republic: The Genesis and Demise of a Paradigm,"Glass intaglios found on a hilltop in Sardis, Turkey are dated by archaeological context to the Augustan period. Iconographic details and the state of the intaglios show that they were made in Sardis, very likely near where they were found. The group of about forty gems gives us insight into the changing sociocultural history of the Sardians at a time when they are adapting to new political realities; they also give us a glimpse of favored motifs of the lower classes, in contrast to the magistrates who paid for local coinages and other euergistic projects."
Adorning and Protecting: Glass Intaglios and the Changing Character of Being a Sardian in the Early Imperial Period,"Generalized Darwinism models cultural development as an evolutionary process, where traits evolve through variation, selection, and inheritance. Inheritance describes either a discrete unit’s transmission or a mixing of traits (i.e., blending inheritance). In this article, we compare classical models of cultural evolution and generalized population dynamics with respect to blending inheritance. We identify problems of these models and introduce our model, which combines relevant features of both. Blending is implemented as success-based social learning, which can be shown to be an optimal strategy."
Cultural Inheritance in Generalized Darwinism,"For this edition of Ask a Feminist, Dolores Huerta—renowned labor organizer, immigrant rights activist, and feminist advocate—speaks with Rachel Rosenbloom, professor of Law at Northeastern University, about the role that gender plays in today’s struggles and social movements, especially those working on behalf of immigrants and workers. Drawing on her long history of organizing, Huerta offers insights on the contemporary political landscape—from the #MeToo movement to the fight for the DREAMers to opposition to Donald Trump. Huerta’s long history of fighting for social justice serves as a crucial guide for building a sustained and intersectional resistance."
Ask a Feminist: Dolores Huerta and Rachel Rosenbloom Discuss Gender and Immigrant Rights,"This article rewrites the history of the tomb of Philip the Bold made for the Chartreuse de Champmol in Dijon, through a close reading and re-transcription of the entire archival record, including some previously unknown documents, paying careful attention to what their terminology and chronology reveal about time, cost, materials and process; it analyses the scale of the project, and in particular the acquisition and working of materials: limestone from Tonnerre, ‘alabaster’ as spolia from  Autun, black marble from Dinant, white marble, presumably from Italy, via Paris, alabaster  from Grenoble and a pinkish limestone from Resne, near Dijon. By reconsidering this record, along with the physical and visual evidence of the existing monument, it argues that there was not one but two tombs made for Philip the Bold: the first was completed by Jean de Marville and then rejected by Philip, and perhaps also by the Carthusians; the  second, that we have today, was started again from scratch in the early 1390s by Claus Sluter, in collaboration, possibly, with Jacques de Baerze. The story of how these two tombs were planned, worked on, adapted or restarted, along with what Marville’s abandoned project may have looked like, and what may have become of its constituent parts, is woven into the narrative of Philip’s political and religious ambitions, the role of  his wife Margaret of Flanders, and of the construction and decoration of the Chartreuse de Champmol itself."
The Two Tombs of Philip the Bold,"There is widespread agreement among economists—and a diverse set of other policy analysts—that at least in the long run, an economy-wide carbon-pricing system will be an essential element of any national policy that can achieve meaningful reductions of CO2 emissions cost-effectively in the United States. There is less agreement, however, among economists and others in the policy community regarding the choice of specific carbon-pricing policy instrument, with some supporting carbon taxes and others favoring cap-and-trade mechanisms. This prompts two important questions: How do the two major approaches to carbon pricing compare on relevant dimensions, including but not limited to efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity? And which of the two approaches is more likely to be adopted in the future in the United States? This paper addresses these questions by drawing on both normative and positive theories of policy instrument choice as they apply to US climate change policy and draws extensively on relevant empirical evidence. The paper concludes with a look at the path ahead, including an assessment of how the two carbon-pricing instruments can be made more politically acceptable."
The Future of US Carbon-Pricing Policy,"Italian mafias—Cosa Nostra, Camorra, and ‘Ndrangheta—are long-lived, resilient organizations that have evolved to adapt to environmental changes. They have different organizational models. While Cosa Nostra (in the past) and ‘Ndrangheta are characterized by a unitary, vertical structure and higher-level coordination bodies, Camorra has a plurality of organizational models; the majority of clans maintain a structure that is fluid, polycentric, and conflictual. In general, mafias with a vertical organizational order have greater control over conflict, and greater capacity to resist state power. The ‘Ndrangheta has become the richest and most powerful of the three, replacing Cosa Nostra in international drug trafficking. It is able to reproduce its organizational structures and business model in new territories in Italy and elsewhere. In contrast, owing to unprecedented law enforcement efforts in recent decades, Cosa Nostra is weaker, down but not out. Camorra continues to be the most violent mafia, committing more homicides than the other two combined. Consistent with their adaptive capacity, mafias in new areas of expansion are treated as novel agents that can provide extralegal services and business opportunities. They are sought out by entrepreneurs, white-collar professionals, and local politicians to solve problems such as debt collection, labor unrest, and disputes with suppliers."
Italian Organized Crime since 1950,"Recent excavations at the site of Zincirli Höyük in southeastern Turkey have revealed significant remains of the Middle Bronze Age II period, with evidence for local food (and probably wine) production and storage, textile production, and administrative activities. Certain cylinder seal and vessel types further indicate that the site was well-integrated into a contemporary exchange network linking the Euphrates, North Syria, and central Anatolia. The newly discovered complex includes the massive Hilani I, heretofore attributed to the Iron Age but now believed to be a Middle Bronze Age temple rather than a bīt ḫilāni palace. This preliminary report presents architecture, ceramics, and small finds associated with this complex, DD, which comprises, in addition to Hilani I, two well-provisioned buildings (DD/I and DD/II), a street, and exterior work spaces, and was destroyed in a conflagration in the mid-17th century b.c.e. Ongoing research by the Chicago-Tübingen Expedition seeks to illuminate the function of Complex DD and Hilani I, as well as the regional significance of the site, including its political relationship to nearby Tilmen Höyük/Zalwar, destroyed in the campaigns of Ḫattušili I, and its role in the trade of luxury commodities such as wine and textiles."
"Middle Bronze Age Zincirli: An Interim Report on Architecture, Small Finds, and Ceramics from a Monumental Complex of the 17th Century b.c.e.","Analytical models of government formation typically assume low-dimensional real policy spaces. Behaviorally, however, politicians negotiate to form governments in high-dimensional discrete issue spaces. We model these negotiations, leveraging the fact that different politicians typically attach different importance to the same issue, allowing gains from trade when they negotiate agreed positions on large packages of issues. The set of issues in an agreed package is endogenous; politicians need not agree on every issue before they go into government together, “tabling” issues on which they agree to disagree. We exercise our model computationally, calibrating it to 91 real-world government formation settings, and mapping out the relative probability of Condorcet winning cabinets in different settings. This probability measures how hard it is for negotiators to find Condorcet winning cabinets in a giant high-dimensional state space. We test this claim empirically with a statistical model of the duration of negotiations after an election."
Government Formation as Logrolling in High-Dimensional Issue Spaces,"This article examines the introduction of chemical dyes into food in the nineteenth century in four different countries: the United States, Britain, Germany, and France. From the early 1860s, chemists produced aniline and azo dyes from coal tar on an industrial scale for the burgeoning European textile industry. However, by the end of the century, hundreds of the new dyes were also being added to food, a use for which they were not designed. This article examines the disagreements among chemists over whether these new chemical substances should be seen as legitimate food ingredients or as food adulterants. This was a period when chemists were establishing themselves as professionals, with chemistry being promoted as a science capable of transforming everyday commodities and solving public health issues. However, chemists’ attempts to mediate the use of chemical dyes as food coloring were complicated by a lack of consensus within the chemical community about how to detect the use of such dyes in food and how to test their toxicity. Chemists also were conflicted in their response to the debate depending on whether they were employed by food or dye manufacturers, or working as food inspectors for the state and local authorities. In their efforts to gain authority as food experts, chemists found themselves in a crowded market of interested parties, including food manufacturers, consumers, and politicians. The article describes the diverse opinions of chemists, manufacturers, consumers, and regulators in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, and the varied regulatory responses in these countries to the use of new chemical dyes in food."
The Introduction of Chemical Dyes into Food in the Nineteenth Century,"I examine a crucial moment in American state building and the structuring of the American public sphere: George Washington’s Farewell Address. George Washington helped shape the politically most salient information technology of his day: the publicly provided circulation of newspapers through the mail. Washington then used this technology in his Farewell Address in order to make his “Friends and Fellow Citizens” into Americans. Washington educated those he named as Americans on their duty to hold their leaders intelligently accountable for those leaders’ foreign policy decisions. Washington used rhetoric, communications technology, and administrative innovation to make a public, a republic, and an empire."
Communications and Empire: George Washington’s Farewell Address,"The aim of this study is to reconstruct the settlement processes in the Meron Ridges during the Iron Age I. Although Yoḥanan Aharoni’s pioneering survey in the Upper Galilee was the foundation for later studies on this subject, only a handful of excavations were carried out in the region. In 1976, the Israel Department of Antiquities conducted a salvage excavation at Mt. Adir and revealed a fortress consisting of three main construction strata dating to the period between the late 11th and 9th centuries b.c.e. The excavation results were never published, which has enabled assumptions regarding its date and geo-political status. In the framework of this study, I publish the hitherto unpublished Mt. Adir finds. In addition, I re-examine the previously published sites at Tel Harashim, Sasa, and Horbat ʿAvot. An analysis of these finds indicates that the fortress at Mt. Adir was built as a government center by a local leader who ruled over the Canaanite settlers of the Meron Ridges area during the Iron Age I period."
Settlement Processes in the Meron Ridges During the Iron Age I,"In 1939 Georgia O’Keeffe traveled to the Territory of Hawai‘i to fulfill a commission for the advertising agency N. W. Ayer & Son. Her expenses were covered in exchange for two paintings to be used in advertisements for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company), an enterprise entangled with the conquest of Hawai‘i. James Dole built his pineapple empire on the dispossession and oppression of Indigenous Hawaiians by U.S. missionaries, businessmen, and politicians. O’Keeffe’s experiences in and paintings of Hawai‘i were structured by colonialism, and Dole advertisements that feature her paintings served to justify and naturalize U.S. conquest. To understand O’Keeffe’s work as participating in the highly racialized project of colonialism is to disrupt dominant histories that, often unwittingly, contribute to the ongoing disenfranchisement of Indigenous peoples. Doing so is an important step toward “decolonizing” the history of American modernism."
Georgia O’Keeffe’s Hawai‘i? Decolonizing the History of American Modernism,"Why do legislative brawls persist even though most citizens do not like them? Physical fights in the legislature present an image of extreme discord and bitter conflict in the democratic process. Original survey data from Taiwan, with its extensive history of legislative brawling, find that Taiwanese citizens view brawls and brawling legislators negatively. We argue that brawls persist despite general unpopularity because opposition legislators can strategically send signals to influential actors, such as strong party supporters in the case of Taiwan. An original panel survey conducted before and after a legislative brawl shows evidence consistent with this argument and demonstrates that brawling causes average evaluations of the legislature and of the democratic process to worsen. Thus, this example of persistent, unpopular partisan conflict helps us understand more generally why politicians might deliberately violate democratic norms and reveals some of the broader consequences of such violations for democratic representation and legitimacy."
Partisan Conflict and Citizens’ Democratic Attitudes: How Partisanship Shapes Reactions to Legislative Brawls,"The explosion of reactor number 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986, is often described as mankind’s biggest nuclear accident. However, describing Chernobyl as an accident works like a broom to sweep away the larger story around it, which is more important. Exploring the larger Chernobyl Zone with the help of two biologists and a centenarian villager, this article shows how the greater Pripyat Marshes, where the 1986 accident took place, was already sullied with elevated levels of man-made radioactivity before the plant was ever built. Major radioactive releases continue in the region to this day. By enlarging the scale and temporal dimension of this history, this article shows how the Chernobyl accident serves as only an exclamation point in a chain of toxic exposures that remastered the landscape, society, politics, and bodies, not just locally, but globally."
Learning to Read the Great Chernobyl Acceleration: Literacy in the More-than-Human Landscapes,"Intergovernmental organizations play a vital role in democracies. Observers have become concerned about the extent to which government behavior in these organizations is responsive to their national constituents, but they find it difficult to identify responsiveness in these complex and nontransparent environments. This article analyzes how European governments use public commitments in Council negotiations to signal responsiveness to their electorates when they cooperate in the European Union. I test the theory using data on public commitments of 27 governments in European legislative negotiations and original data from a conjoint survey experiment. The findings suggest that governments defend positions that favor their domestic constituents when they face national elections. The results of an experiment with German citizens provides evidence that governments do so because voters respond favorably to public commitments, as long as these commitments are responsive to the respondent’s own position on the policy issue."
Public Commitments as Signals of Responsiveness in the European Union,"This is a three-part perspective on a single work of art: Edward Savage’s The Washington Family (1789–96). Mia L. Bagneris’s essay places this painting alongside other images of George Washington with African diasporic subjects from the eighteenth century to the present to illuminate how the iconic image of the founding father—upheld as a symbol of the values of the nation itself—was and is inextricably bound up in White supremacy and anti-Blackness. Jennifer Van Horn’s analysis is cartographic in focus, situating the painting in relation to geographic debates about slavery and the racialized contest over mobility in light of the relocation of the enslaved person depicted, and in relation to a second version of the image displayed at Henry Clay’s Kentucky plantation. Jennifer Germann uncovers the hidden history of the painting’s London creation to explore Savage’s choice of the enslaved attendant portrait format, and his selection of free Black model John Riley, amidst the uncertainty surrounding the portrayal of Black figures in the 1780s and 1790s. She elucidates how disremembering has obscured John Riley as well as historical Black subjects in American art more broadly."
Remapping Resistance: The Place of Slavery in The Washington Family,"The Supreme Court’s campaign finance jurisprudence rests on a distinction between spending restrictions (generally struck) and contribution restrictions (often upheld). In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the case originating this distinction, the majority rejected an “anti-distortion” rationale for spending restrictions, claiming that campaign spending is merely an effect of candidate support, not a cause of candidate support. If this claim is true, then removing restrictions on campaign spending should have no discernible causal impacts. This article tests the Buckley majority’s empirical claim using its own ruling, which struck limits on campaign spending in state elections in 26 states. Estimates consistently suggest that the Buckley-induced removal of state limits on campaign spending led to increased Republican vote shares, increased Republican candidate entry, and decreased Democratic candidate entry in state legislative and gubernatorial elections in states affected by the ruling, as well as increased Republican House vote shares and the election of more conservative House incumbents in states both affected by the ruling and holding concurrent federal and state elections. These findings suggest that the rationale for the core distinction in the Supreme Court’s campaign finance jurisprudence has little empirical foundation."
Insecure Institutions: A Survivalist Theory of Judicial Manipulation in Latin America,"The Roman satirist Lucilius’ Concilium deorum attacks a politician, Lupus. His name, which means “sea-bass” or “wolf,” occasions comedy with cultural-historical underpinnings. An earlier Lucilian fragment concerned a philosophically inspired judgment by Lupus, so the Concilium’s animal metaphors have philosophical import. The poet’s name begins with the Greek for “wolf,” so satirist and target are alike, and similarly Greek-inflected. And the penalty Lupus earlier handed down resembles the poena cullei for parricide, which implicates wolves. As a fragment of the Concilium involves fathers, the disparate references to Lupus are linked and the satirist himself implicated. Lucilius’ critique proves clever and subtle."
Front Cover,"An epidemic of bubonic plague engulfed Vietnam during the 1960s. Strikingly, it has all but vanished from historical accounts of the Vietnam War. By reading US military medical sources with and against writings by critics of the war and placing both in relation to scholarship in environmental history, this article seeks to recover a narrative of the bubonic plague epidemic in Vietnam. In doing so, it offers a fresh perspective on more familiar stories of defoliation, deforestation, and warfare, illustrating not only how these histories crisscross and overlap in vital ways that have remained barely legible in extant scholarship but also how a plague epidemic can evaporate into “nature” when it is politically expedient for it to do so. The disappearance of the epidemic in our histories of the Vietnam War reflects what can happen when the very terms for how to make sense of a medical crisis become politicized and the existence and extent of that crisis are disputed. The consequences of such a contest over meaning fit a long-standing pattern in histories of social medicine and public health in the United States, especially when those histories intersect with histories of race and racism."
Is Campaign Spending a Cause or an Effect? Reexamining the Empirical Foundations of Buckley v. Valeo (1976),"This introduction demonstrates the critical place of rage in our contemporary moment in the face of the catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic, the surge of protests against police killings and the global Movement for Black Lives, and ongoing dissent against rising authoritarianisms around the world. In her overview of the special issue, Carla Kaplan explores the rich tradition of feminist scholarship on rage from Audre Lorde to Adrienne Rich. Kaplan reflects on the essential work of Signs in this moment as a critical space for engaged feminist public scholarship in a time of protest and crisis. Sarah Haley traces how Black feminist theories of rage have been foundational to broad feminist critiques of state violence and visions for a sustainable, livable world. Yet, Haley argues, Black feminisms are too often treated as a “commodity fetish,” appearing primarily as a citation rather than as a subject of extended engagement and analysis. Durba Mitra analyzes how feminist protest defines our contemporary moment, with no single origin and no end in sight. Mitra highlights the diverse modes of feminist outrage in global protests, from singing and dancing to art making, through the example of the Shaheen Bagh protests against anti-Muslim laws in India. The final section highlights the wide-ranging feminist themes linked to rage in the issue: protests in Puerto Rico, trans politics, intersex protest, sex work, carcerality, the question of white womanhood, white women’s gun ownership, disability, transnational #feminisms against sexual violence and femicide in Kenya and South Africa, Black girlhood, Indigenous feminisms, and disobedient humor in the age of Trump."
"Living among Wolves, Acting Like a Wolf: Lucilius’ Attacks on Lupus","This article focuses on the exceptional appeal to modernists of pulquerías: working-class Mexican bars often generously painted on their exteriors. Specifically, this article focuses on two essays published by Diego Rivera and illustrated with photographs by Edward Weston that appeared in the bilingual journal Mexican Folkways in 1926. Through their praise, the two artists sought to align themselves both aesthetically and politically with the popular. Set against the backgrounds of folk revivals in both the United States and Mexico, as well as the Mexican mural movement, each artist drew on a distinct aspect of the pulquerías to make their own modernist art—Rivera on the tragicomic vacilada and Weston on the tension between representation and the real. Rather than reinforce the binary relationships Rivera and Weston imagined to exist between tradition and modernity, this article argues for the hybridity of both modernist and folk art constructs. Far from requiring either modernist “salvage” or transformation, an idea that forecloses the possibility of folk art’s dynamic development, the pulquerías proved to be equally responsive to the conditions of modernity."
Making Sense of Plague in the Vietnam War,"The introduction to this symposium provides a working definition of populist parties and movements and then examines the rise in their support in Europe and the implications of populist rule. As does the symposium as a whole, it highlights the diversity of populisms, identifies the crisis of representation as a root cause of the populist rise, and examines the consequences of populist rule for formal institutions, informal norms of democracy, and representation itself."
Conclusion: The Paths Forward,"How does state repression affect civilians’ preferences for dissent? This essay examines administrative demolition orders issued against Palestinian structures in the West Bank. As administrative demolition is a penalty for illegal building and is not provoked by Palestinian violence and radicalization, the policy’s impact can be estimated while avoiding the challenge of reverse causality. Drawing on United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Demolition Order database and Palestinian opinion polls during 2001–12, the study finds that in the long run, the policy hardens preferences: as the number of demolition orders issued increases, Palestinians are more likely to oppose peace and support violence against Israelis. By demonstrating the provocative effect of collective threat, the study sheds light on a mechanism by which repression backfires. For the policy of administrative demolition, the findings suggest that while ostensibly exogenous to conflict dynamics, the practice has consequences for the peace process."
Outraged/Enraged: The Rage Special Issue,"Policy makers have time-inconsistent preferences if they fear losing power or are endowed with hyperbolic discount factors. Politicians may thus seek to influence future policy choices, for example, by investing in green technologies that motivate later politicians to act sustainably. I show that optimal investment subsidies are larger for technologies that are strategic complements to future investments, that are further upstream in the supply chain, or that are characterized by longer maturity. Time inconsistency can rationalize subsidies at similar levels as market failures such as externalities can. Furthermore, the two are superadditive: time inconsistency and strategic investments are especially important for long-term policies associated with externalities."
"“The Last Word in Direct Naive Realism”: Diego Rivera, Edward Weston, and Pulquerías","The idea that there might be democratic forms of non-participation has been largely overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on democracy. Non-participation has variously been seen as a threat to the proper functioning of democracy, as a rational choice, or (more rarely) as potentially beneficial at the systems level. We argue that there are forms of non-participation that may be justified on democratic grounds. Our main theoretical move is to distinguish between reflectivity (or thoughtfulness) and participation. We argue that the normative value of both participation and non-participation is conditioned by reflectivity, such that there may be democratically desirable forms of reflective non-participation. To support our claims, we provide examples of how non-participation can help support democratic goods—such as inclusion, influence, and legitimacy—that are normally associated only with democratic participation."
The Dynamics of Issue Salience: Immigration and Public Opinion,"The effects of large banks on the real economy are theoretically ambiguous and politically controversial. I identify quasi-exogenous increases in bank size in postwar Germany. I show that firms did not grow faster after their relationship banks became bigger. In fact, opaque borrowers grew more slowly. The enlarged banks did not increase profits or efficiency but worked with riskier borrowers. Bank managers benefited through higher salaries and media attention. The results are based on newly digitized microdata on German firms and their banks. Overall, the findings reveal that bigger banks do not always raise real growth and can actually harm some borrowers and the real economy."
Introduction,"The Democratic Party in the United States, like other left-leaning parties around the world, is struggling to counter the rise of right-wing populism. The premise of this symposium is that the party’s challenges have deep historical roots and are problems of modern liberal governance more generally. Despite their different perspectives on the sources of, and their different solutions for, the Democratic Party’s difficulties, the essays are united in arguing that a more robust, substantive public philosophy is needed to generate a governing majority."
The Authoritarian Personality,"Tensions over borders lie at the center of a growing global debate. But while politicians argue, some US higher education institutions (HEIs) have made education and protections possible for displaced students. Using securitization theory and social movement theory to examine the role of HEIs as they responded to immigration policies attempted by the Trump Administration, this article compares interventions in the United States for undocumented “DREAMers” and at-risk international students primarily from Muslim-majority countries. Both populations have been singled out as security threats by anti-immigration rhetoric and new restrictive policies. While priorities and practices of US HEIs and related agencies toward these at-risk populations indicate competing values, interests, and roles, they also evidence a humanitarian impulse to help. This article investigates the range of responses documented and concludes with recommendations for further research."
Introduction,"One of the fundamental weaknesses of popular collective action in China is a lack of broad-based solidarity. This article examines the collective protests by workers at state-owned enterprises when many of them were restructured from the mid-1990s through the mid-2010s, which often led to downsizing, closures, or privatization. The article draws on interviews conducted with retirees and laid-off workers from 91 restructured state-owned enterprises in a city in Hunan Province, plus an in-depth case study of one factory there. The evidence shows that the local state was able to fragment labor activism not only by using intimidation and coercion to prevent broad-based mobilization but also by creating incentives for workers to pursue narrow identities and particularistic claims. This explains why the workers’ mobilization was often counterproductive—rather than building up group solidarity, their mobilization tended to divide and demoralize workers’ communities. The study examines the nature of the divisions between worker groups and shows which specific types of groups were able to persevere and which types were able to transcend a single firm in their claims. This article also indicates that divisions between worker groups were not always predetermined by socioeconomic cleavages but instead often resulted from workers’ interactions with the government and with each other. The findings provide insights into the limits of popular collective action in China."
Israeli Demolition Orders and Palestinian Preferences for Dissent,"The comparative literature on presidential systems has paid little attention to the causes that explain variation in executive power concentration. We use the case of nineteenth century Chile to uncover the causal path that led to one of Latin America’s most far-reaching yet gradual sets of reforms that weakened presidential power. Combining theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of institutions, ideas, networks, and ambiguity, this article seeks to explain how and why Chile went from having one of the most constitutionally powerful presidents in Latin America to one of the weakest, as part of a gradual reform process that lasted three decades."
Dreaming Differently,"Although Democrats reject the Republican Party’s exclusionary definition of America, they nonetheless struggle to articulate an alternative vision of national community capable of mobilizing a governing majority around a national program. I explore the challenge of national identity and national purpose for the Democratic Party—and the country—by finding sources for it in features of America’s creedal identity, but also in twentieth-century party developments and governing choices. Blurring the meaning of key terms of the party’s public philosophy and national liberal identity, embracing administrative expertise as well as party and interest pluralism, and relying on procedural solutions to escape value differences between coalitional partners, the history of choices made by the Democratic Party has left it ill-equipped to persuade voters that it has a singular, substantive vision of national community that acknowledges, and yet unites, citizens across their diverse concerns and aspirations."
Technology and Time Inconsistency,"The aims of this study of four photographs by Hippolyte Bayard that were taken in Paris between 1848 and 1850 are twofold. One objective is to provide the historical details necessary to understand the ways in which the images engaged with events of the 1848 Revolution. The other is to bring attention to how photography’s contribution to the historical record differs from that of other visual media such as paintings, prints, and drawings. The fact that the photograph denoted a temporal specificity put Bayard in the unique position of being able to evince the transitional and ephemeral nature of the 1848 Revolution that so many of his contemporaries remarked upon."
Ways of Seeing,"After World War II, collectively bargained private pensions were installed as an alternative to Social Security expansions. But these plans began to go into decline in the 1980s, when defined-contribution retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, came to replace them. This article makes three arguments about this rise and fall to contribute toward a theory of structural contingency. First, in both episodes, state intervention into labor-management relations triggered policy changes in the private pension system. Second, policy makers were motivated to intervene because of a structural condition—namely, to manage perceived crises in capitalism. And third, the particular way they intervened and how their policy choices spurred pension marketization were driven by contingent historical circumstances. This article argues that structural constraints that inhere in capitalist democracies established a range of possible policy options available to policy makers, yet contingent and historical factors channeled policy selection within that range."
Democratic Non-Participation,"In a politically charged social climate, many disciplines are inwardly grappling with historic ideologies and systems of oppression. In information science, critical librarianship seeks to disrupt normative approaches to library work by confronting these ideologies and systems, empowering both library workers and users to understand how these structures affect access and dissemination of information. In industrial design, critical design challenges the status quo by posing troublesome design problems that encourage reflection and discourse. Design works that fall under this category are reactions against consumerism, systemic biases, and heedless scientific and technological development. In librarianship, critical design may be employed to help us explore current paradigms and approaches to library spaces, services, and technologies, as well as to uncover assumptions about what a library is and what a librarian does. Prototypes and narratives derived from critical design can make visible the normative constructions and problems heartedly debated in librarianship."
Are Bigger Banks Better? Firm-Level Evidence from Germany,"The introduction to this symposium opens a discussion on the transformation of the liberal international order through studies of regions located at Europe’s margins, where new dynamics of power relations are on the rise and the appeal of illiberal ideas and forms of governance is growing. The symposium’s articles give a variety of analytical perspectives on different types, forms, and modalities of regionalism unfolding in the institutional, normative, cultural, and economic spaces where Europe meets its neighbors. The contributors address whether the European Union is losing control over its periphery and to what kind of international order (liberal, illiberal, or both) the emerging new regionalisms are contributing."
A World Well Lost?,"The ratification referendum is the most common and recommended means of concluding a constitution-making process. This paper questions its desirability by undercutting the procedure’s most popular justification: to provide a means for the popular sovereign, the constituent power, to enter the constitution-making process and make the constitution its own. I argue that this justification fails because taking popular authorship seriously in the one-shot setting of constitution making requires that citizens be capable of understanding and evaluating the constitution, and we should expect voters, through no fault of their own, to lack the technical and complex information needed to do so. If there are good reasons to submit constitutions to referendums, these do not include those that hand wave toward the importance of popular sovereignty. Either the procedure should be dropped from constitution-making best practices, or a new more convincing justification needs to be given."
A Tribute to Bill Havard: Founder of NPSA and Polity,"Many believe that President Trump’s criticisms of the judiciary pose real and immediate threats to judicial legitimacy. However, framing theory suggests that source credibility is a prerequisite for such frames to be effective. Relying on an experiment embedded in a multiwave, nationally representative sample of Americans, we examine whether public attacks on the judiciary—by either Trump or distinguished law professors—affect the US Supreme Court’s legitimacy. We demonstrate that criticisms of the Court from either source are only deleterious among respondents who believe the source is credible; source credibility also shapes agreement with the criticism. Because President Trump is viewed with distrust by a majority of Americans, his comments pose only a limited threat to the Court’s legitimacy. However, our data also suggest that a more credible source (inside or outside government), using similar attacks, could do considerable damage to the legitimacy of the American government’s most fragile branch."
Concerning Justice,"We investigate whether communicating constituents’ preferences to legislators increases the responsiveness of delegates to the Vietnamese National Assembly (VNA). Using a randomized control trial, we assign legislators to three groups: (1) those briefed on the opinions of their provincial citizenry, (2) those presented with the preferences of local firms, and (3) those receiving only information on the Communist Party’s objectives. Because voting data are not public, we collect data on a range of other potentially responsive behaviors during the 2018 session. These include answers to a VNA Library survey about debate readiness; whether delegates spoke in group caucuses, query sessions, and floor debates; and the content of those speeches. We find consistent evidence that citizen-treated delegates were more responsive, via debate preparation and the decision to speak, than control delegates; evidence from speech content is mixed."
Thinking Comparatively,"The salience of judicial institutions in democratic and nondemocratic countries has increased, making it important to have women on these powerful and visible decision-making bodies. Yet, women have only recently gained entrance to peak judicial bodies including constitutional and supreme courts. The appointment of the first woman to a high court is a historic landmark, breaking traditional ideas of who can and should be on the court. Using a global, longitudinal data set we show that certain explanatory factors matter differently in wealthy, stable democracies and in developing countries. The method of selecting high court justices exerts influence in wealthy, stable democracies but not newer ones. Further, our findings suggest that in both sets of countries, appointments to high courts are not made in a domestic vacuum and are influenced by international norms of having women participate in governing institutions."
"Rawls, Genealogy, History","This article examines a paradigm shift in the PRC that has occurred over the past two decades which has transformed the meaning of “minority nationality” (shaoshu minzu). Today, the very concept of minority nationalities is perceived by Beijing as entailing a threat to the Chinese state and the Chinese nation. The shift underlies a change of China’s institutional form from a “multinational state” to a “unified community of the Chinese nation.” The result is the current heavy-handed approach toward China’s minority peoples, especially in borderlands such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia. The article suggests that these minority nationalities are now understood by the Chinese leadership to constitute veritable Frankenstein’s monsters that were created by the Party’s minority-nationality classification system and have now grown strong enough to attack their creator."
Reasoning with the Exclusionary Other: Classical Scenes for a Postradical Horizon,"In contrast to the democratic principle that all adults should enjoy the right to vote, which is now a global norm, nonvoting has escaped any sort of historical closure. Millions of electors have always failed to vote, whether under conditions of limited, mass, or fully universal suffrage—and, in most Western states, electoral abstention is now at record levels. Yet despite its long-standing status as a popular phenomenon, nonvoting has received scant attention from historians of democracy. In this article we begin the task of rehabilitating nonvoting as a significant historical variable by analyzing how the problem has evolved in two major European states, Britain and France, from the mid-nineteenth century up to the present. The argument is twofold. The first aspect is that nonvoting is a composite phenomenon, one whose shifting public profile and capacity to provoke alarm has always been determined by the interaction of multiple elements, chief among them conceptions of citizenship and electoral representation. The second aspect is that in both countries nonvoting has provoked a variety of competing appraisals regarding the precise problem it poses, prompting debate about the extent to which it should be tolerated, and what, if anything, should be done about it, including making voting compulsory. We conclude by arguing that the history of nonvoting suggests that the process of democratization has been marked throughout by an inability to resolve the relationship between representative ideals of electoral legitimacy and the rights and duties of those equipped with the franchise."
Left Turn on a Red Light? Challenges and Decisions Facing Liberals and Progressives After 2016,"In this paper I explore the nexus of slavery, diaspora, and citizenship through the close examination of the complex negotiations of “diasporic citizenship” in Ghana. Over the past 25 years, Ghana has been a major site for diasporic homecoming, both in terms of tourism and repatriation. This movement has been accompanied by multiple demands and promises of citizenship. I discuss three dimensions of citizenship that speak to the problematics of inclusion and exclusion in the rhetoric and practice of diasporic homecoming. First, there is citizenship as an affective claim to belonging; second, there is citizenship as a legal status (and obligation); and third, there is the renegotiation of citizenship through genetic ancestry. Articulated in terms of soul, dual citizenship, and embodied link, these citizenship claims and practices transcend and challenge the strict limits of the nation-state, thereby pointing toward the “crisis of citizenship” as a larger problem."
Comparing the Responses of US Higher Education Institutions to International and Undocumented Students in the Trump Era,"Do renewable terms compromise judicial independence? Scholars of various courts have demonstrated relationships between judges’ voting patterns and the interests of actors responsible for their (re)appointment. However, it is typically unclear whether such relationships are (at least partially) explained by judges acting strategically to achieve reappointment or if they are (fully) attributable to selection effects. I exploit a 2010 reform of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to estimate the causal effect of removing reappointment opportunities on judges’ independence. The ECtHR bench consists of one judge from each member state, and judges sit ex officio on cases involving their nominating state. Prior to 2010, terms were renewable. Judges seeking reappointment were therefore incentivized to favor their nominating states. In 2010, the terms were made nonrenewable, with immediate effect for judges on the court. I show that removing reappointment opportunities significantly reduced judges’ tendency to favor their nominating states."
Introduction: Religion and Borders in (Post–)Cold War Peripheries,"Secularization, according to Max Weber’s classic theory, shatters social cohesion. But if this is so, what are the prospects for democratic solidarity in a secular age? In this article, I examine the response given by one of democracy’s leading intellectual architects, Jürgen Habermas. Whereas Weber thought that rational modernity enfeebles solidarity, Habermas believes that rational discourse itself inherits religion’s moral-aesthetic power, a process that he calls the “linguistification of the sacred.” Habermas’s stress on language, I argue, is partly justified. Yet as I show by tracing linguistification’s roots to Émile Durkheim’s sociology of religion and Walter Benjamin’s theory of language, Habermas’s program for solidarity falls short in one crucial respect. While shared discourse cultivates a basic interpersonal tolerance, it lacks the power to transport us beyond our narrow interests. Nonrational and prelinguistic aspects of our psychology remain decisive. Consequently, democratic solidarity in a secular age remains an unfinished project."
The Logic of Fragmented Activism among Chinese State-Owned Enterprise Workers,"For some, the 1967 war meant a setback to grand Arab projects; but the Palestinians understood the war in physical and epistemic terms. This is because the war made it clear to them that Israel and Zionism are capable of physically erasing Palestine as well as its history. The Palestinian existential fear of epistemic erasure (athazagoraphobia), following the complete occupation of their land, has produced works that affirm epistemic presence through the assertion of history and ownership. Athazagoraphobia refers to an existential human fear of death both physically and memorially––namely, human continuity. As a result, Palestinian discourse, responding to athazagoraphobia, centers around questions of origins, genealogy, and beginnings. Moreover, Palestinian reaction to athazagoraphobia opens up a discussion about the impact of this reaction on larger intellectual projects that deal with universal themes. Consequently, this article offers additional insights into the relationship between the 1948 and 1967 wars."
“We Don’t See Any Dream … Only the American Nightmare”,"Politicians and scholars often link humiliation to decisions to initiate and escalate international military conflict, yet the microfoundations underlying this link are undertheorized and untested. Can emotions, like humiliation, actually affect international bargaining? If so, through what mechanisms does humiliation operate? Drawing on studies in neuroscience and experimental psychology, this article offers two new mechanisms through which humiliation may influence conflict preferences: by decreasing sensitivity to the cost of conflict and by increasing the salience of potential status loss. This change in preferences shrinks the bargaining range, increasing the probability of bargaining breakdown. I test this theory using both survey and lab experiments that exploit the carryover effects of humiliation on unrelated decisions to isolate its effects on conflict preferences. The results provide the first experimental evidence able to distinguish support for different mechanisms through which humiliation increases conflict preferences."
"Gradual Change and Deconcentration of Presidential Powers in Nineteenth Century Chile: Ideas, Networks, and Institutional Ambiguity","In 1560, the Augustinian cardinal Girolamo Seripando commissioned a chapel and library in the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara in Naples. In the late fifteenth century, this congregation had taken a distinctive intellectual path, harmonizing humanistic study with Christian faith. Seripando’s collection provided a living, systematic reflection of how Observant Augustinian thought had emerged from, and complemented, the humanist movement over the course of several generations, to emerge as a politically independent contemporary Christian theology profoundly rooted in classical literature and the legacy of Plato, seen through the lens of Augustine, the thirteenth-century Augustinian theologian Giles of Rome, and Seripando’s influential mentor, the Augustinian prior general and cardinal Giles of Viterbo."
An Identity Crisis for the Democrats?,"Is capitalism compatible with democratic equality? Rawls’s critique of welfare-state capitalism implies a negative answer. I argue that Rawls’s critique fails and that welfare-state capitalism can satisfy the demands of democratic equality. I articulate a social democratic interpretation of the ideal of democratic equality and show that it justifies welfare-state capitalism. This argument also implies that welfare-state capitalism can satisfy the demands of democratic equality as interpreted by Rawls’s justice as fairness. So, whether we accept Rawls’s interpretation of democratic equality or the social democratic alternative, welfare-state capitalism can satisfy the demands of democratic equality."
Traces of History: Hippolyte Bayard’s Photographs of the 1848 Revolution,"Are voters motivated by policy preferences or partisan identities? In this paper, we argue that the British Conservative Party’s sudden change in Brexit policy (following the surprising result of the 2016 referendum on EU membership) offers a unique opportunity to study partisanship in the context of a natural experiment. Using an interrupted time series design, we find evidence that voters care primarily about policy: Europhilic Conservatives disaffiliated from the party, while Euroskeptics became more likely to identify with the Conservatives. These findings suggest that voters are sufficiently policy motivated to change parties if they disagree with their party on important issues. But we find that partisan identities do play a role in the development of voter preferences in another issue area: voters who joined the Conservatives immediately after the referendum subsequently adopted more right-wing views on economic redistribution."
Aurelio Lippo Brandolini’s Republics and Kingdoms Compared and the Paradoxes of Humanist Monarchism,"Existing research on public opinion under authoritarianism focuses on the deliberative half of cognition. Yet in psychology, implicit attitudes and subconscious associations are often viewed as foundational, the basis for explicit attitudes and behavior. This article adapts the well-known Implicit Association Test to study Egyptian citizens’ attitudes toward President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Roughly 58% of respondents hold positive implicit attitudes toward Sisi. The data also allow for an investigation of attitude dissociation, whereby individuals hold distinct implicit and explicit attitudes toward a target object. Government employees and Coptic Christians are more likely to hold positive explicit attitudes toward Sisi but negative or neutral implicit attitudes. The correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes toward Sisi is weaker than found in comparable studies of democratic leaders, which provides evidence that self-presentational concerns are at work."
Structural Contingencies: Capitalist Constraints and Historical Contingency in the Rise and Fall of Pensions,"In recent years China’s Communist Party leadership has drawn attention to the lessons of imperial history for China’s modern system of cadre (ganbu) management. The Party’s focus on history draws attention to points of continuity and discontinuity between the bureaucratic systems of the empire and the People’s Republic. This article considers the historical framework of territorial government under which officials operate and the historical trajectory of bureaucratic control over territorially based communities over the longue durée, from the imperial period through the early Republic and into the People’s Republic under Xi Jinping. By approaching the Communist Party’s cadre system as a historical outgrowth of an earlier system of territorial administration, this article brings to light assumptions dating from the late imperial period that continue to underpin the exclusive power and privileges attached to the position of officials in China, which create, in effect, a nation of cadres."
Critical Design in Librarianship: Visual and Narrative Exploration for Critical Praxis,"To become aware of the depth of the ecological mutation, one has to criticize the notion of abstract space. It turns out that, in many of his works, Carl Schmitt has found ways to politicize the production of neutral depoliticized space. This is especially true in “Dialogue on New Space.” The dialogue summarizes Schmitt’s earlier works, but it also tries to relate, audaciously, the character of being human with the different conceptions of space entertained by each protagonist of the dialogue. Especially important in the plot is the interpretation of the expression of “unencumbered technology” that Schmitt associates with the destiny of liberalism and the sort of spatial domination ad infinitum that it implies. The final point of the dialogue is that you cannot be really human in the wrong space. The article does not pretend to make Schmitt a thinker of ecology but to extract from his highly peculiar critique of space something that could be useful to help criticize a depoliticized notion of green space."
Jonas Staal: Re-Forming Representation,"In De republica, Cicero describes his ideal statesman as a helmsman, a metaphor associated with sole rule in the rhetorical tradition. This comparison has been used to argue that Cicero saw individual authority as a solution to civic strife. When viewed in relation to his contemporary oratory, however, an alternative reading emerges. His speeches use ship-of-state symbolism to transform the helmsman into a model for collegial governance. Portraying the subordination of individual helmsmen to the senatorial helm, they reconcile exemplary statesmanship with the mixed constitution and offer an answer to what has been called “the issue of individual preeminence” in De republica."
Introduction: “Bad Weather” Regionalism and the Post-Liberal International Order at Europe’s Margins,"Scholars and artists have long been interested in socially engaged artworks, particularly those involving civil disobedience. But what of the opposite approach? What of radical adherence? In the 1970s, California-based artist Lowell Darling realized a series of creative endeavors exploiting uncivil obedience, characterized by a conspicuous and hyperbolic compliance with established laws, rules, and mandates. Following the disallowance of proposed deductions to his 1969 federal income tax return, Darling—by way of projects such as the fictional Fat City School of Finds Arts—deconstructed the so-called hobby loss rule of the U.S. Tax Code by rigorously and ironically fulfilling those factors said to indicate a profit-seeking intent. In 1978, Darling mined the intricacies of electioneering norms and campaign finance by staging an insincere run for governor of California. In these projects, Darling mobilized a kind of legal medium for creative expression, manifesting a mode of art-making that departed from expectations about how art and law might interact and intersect within art practice."
Ilja Nieuwland. American Dinosaur Abroad: A Cultural History of Carnegie’s Plaster Diplodocus.,"We argue that wealthy elites in democracies can limit their taxes by constraining the fiscal capacity of the state. Corrupting local officials and undermining fiscal capacity are some of the mechanisms by which high-income earners can lower their own tax liabilities, even when voters favor higher de jure levels of taxation. The incentive to undermine fiscal capacity is especially compelling when inequality is high, as the median voter is likely to support higher progressive taxation and redistribution. Using data from over 5,500 Brazilian municipalities, we show that localities with higher levels of inequality accrue less revenue from local property taxes. These results are robust to estimating a number of cross-sectional models as well as panel models with time and municipal fixed effects. Moreover, we show that municipalities with high levels of inequality are less likely to apply to a federal grant program to increase their capacity to collect taxes."
The People Cannot Choose a Constitution: Constituent Power’s Inability to Justify Ratification Referendums,"The author examines the formation of Israelite identity in relation to the formation of the Israelite monarchy in the Iron I–IIA central Canaanite hill country. Drawing on recent studies regarding the significant role of kinship in ancient Near Eastern societies, this article reflects on Israelite identity as a kinship identity. It begins with a brief discussion of settlement patterns and oscillations in the central Canaanite hill country during the Iron I–IIA in the context of the formation of the Israelite monarchy. As kinship is a social ideology, the relevant textual sources are also examined, leading to the conclusion that it is the process of “state formation,” with its constant need to form politically and socially unified structures under centralized rule, that generated the construction of an encompassing Israelite identity."
How Does Hyperpoliticized Rhetoric Affect the US Supreme Court’s Legitimacy?,"Multilevel regression with poststratification (MrP) has quickly become the gold standard for small area estimation. While the first MrP models did not include context-level information, current applications almost always make use of such data. When using MrP, researchers are faced with three problems: how to select features, how to specify the functional form, and how to regularize the model parameters. These problems are especially important with regard to features included at the context level. We propose a systematic approach to estimating MrP models that addresses these issues by employing a number of machine learning techniques. We illustrate our approach using 89 items from public opinion surveys in the United States and demonstrate that our approach outperforms a standard MrP model in which the choice of context-level variables has been informed by a rich tradition of public opinion research."
Testing Legislator Responsiveness to Citizens and Firms in Single-Party Regimes: A Field Experiment in the Vietnamese National Assembly,"This article responds to Bridges’s call to rethink the character of the humanities in the face of their record of inhumanity by interrogating the fitness of means proposed to end desired. If Bridges’s narrative of the inhumanities is to be accepted, this leaves little reason to hope that the cycle could be broken by any new, substantive account of the human. Instead it locates hope in the potential for critical correction and enlarging of perspective exemplified in Bridges’s examples, proposing a hybrid account of the humanities’ value that combines Bridges’s “epistemological” argument about the power of the humanities to generate innovative solutions to real-world problems with an “existential” argument about the epistemic limitations of human nature."
Breaking the Judicial Glass Ceiling: The Appointment of Women to High Courts Worldwide,"In this article, we argue that within multilingual polities, whether national or transnational, multilingual parties are all-things-considered more desirable than monolingual parties operating via a lingua franca. First, we develop a taxonomy of what we believe are the main ideal-type models of “linguistic democracy,” that is, of the relationship between language and democracy in multilingual polities. Second, we argue that multilingual parties are in a better position than monolingual parties to formulate conceptions of the common good that take into account diverse linguistic and epistemic perspectives. Third, we claim that such parties can perform an educational role for their members and for citizens in general, by making them aware of the implications of linguistic diversity for democratic life. Fourth, we argue that multilingual parties can offer a linkage between citizens and government via forms of intraparty deliberation that are rendered more inclusive and democratic by the use of multiple languages."
Courts and State-Building: The Welsh Marcher Lordships and the Somali Union of Islamic Courts,"This article examines the roles of courts in state-building and aims to bring the state-building literature into deeper conversation with institutional approaches to the study of courts. Doing so highlights that courts can play important roles in state-building including extracting revenue, coercing subjects, and generating legitimacy for the state by justly adjudicating disputes. Of these, courts’ extractive role has been especially understudied. Yet, courts can raise significant sums through fees, fines, and confiscating property, particularly in less-developed states. These three roles of courts in state-building are explored in two highly disparate cases: the medieval Welsh Marcher lordships and the Union of Islamic Courts in twenty-first century Somalia."
"Sing with Me, Sing, Brother, of América","Normatively inappropriate scientific dissent prevents warranted closure of scientific controversies and confuses the public about the state of policy-relevant science, such as anthropogenic climate change. Against recent criticism by de Melo-Martín and Intemann of the viability of any conception of normatively inappropriate dissent, I identify three conditions for normatively inappropriate dissent: its generation process is politically illegitimate, it imposes an unjust distribution of inductive risks, and it adopts evidential thresholds outside an accepted range. I supplement these conditions with an inference-to-the-best-explanation account of knowledge-based consensus and dissent to allow policy makers to reliably identify unreliable scientific dissent."
When Is Scientific Dissent Epistemically Inappropriate?,"This article has two main aims. First, it seeks to demonstrate the continuity of The Authoritarian Personality with the model of “early Critical Theory” that was developed at the Institute for Social Research in the 1930s. Second, it attempts to show why The Authoritarian Personality—and early Critical Theory more generally—are still essential to understanding the frightening resurgence of authoritarianism in the United States in recent times. The article begins with an overview of the Institute’s analyses in the 1930s of authoritarianism. It continues with an examination of how the empirical research carried out by the Institute in the U.S. in the 1940s informed Theodor Adorno’s understanding of American society and the ways in which the U.S. embodies larger tendencies at work in modern capitalism as a whole. The third part of the article focuses on the key concept of pseudo-conservatism in The Authoritarian Personality, which was intended to describe the specific form that potentially authoritarian forces assume in the U.S. The article concludes with some observations about the recent resurgence of authoritarianism in the U.S. and some reflections upon how The Authoritarian Personality and early Critical Theory can still help us understand—and counter—them."
The Concept of Pseudo-Conservatism as a Link Between The Authoritarian Personality and Early Critical Theory,"“Abortion as Gender Transgression” tells the story of End Fake Clinics, a queer reproductive justice student club at the University of California, Santa Barbara, that worked with their student government to make UCSB the only university to ban crisis pregnancy centers from falsely advertising on campus. In this article—the first to analyze anti–crisis pregnancy center activism—we draw from End Fake Clinics’ work to outline the contours of what a queer reproductive justice politic might entail. Through archiving and analyzing End Fake Clinics’ Queering Reproductive Justice workshop, we argue that approaching abortion as a form of gender transgression allows us to recognize deeper connections between queer and reproductive issues, as well as to complicate this very distinction. In the case of End Fake Clinics, creating a queer reproductive justice politic was enabled, we argue, by the deep affective connections developed through the group as well as by participants’ collective belief that their activism would be best when informed by feminist and queer theory. In discussing what we describe as End Fake Clinics’ epistemologically based and affectively bound activism, we expand on the limited feminist scholarship on crisis pregnancy centers and queer theoretical scholarship on reproduction, putting these bodies of thought into conversation in new ways. As reproductive justice activists and scholars have begun to use the phrase “queering reproductive justice” to refer to the reproductive concerns of LGBTQ people, and as increasing numbers of LGBTQ people engage in reproduction, End Fake Clinics provides us with more complicated ways to approach queering reproductive justice beyond such identitarian models."
Establishment Clause Appeasement,"Why do ethnically diverse elites share power in government coalitions? I argue that uncertainty about their societal support makes ethnic leaders frequently form oversized coalitions when their group does not represent an overwhelming majority. This uncertainty stems from crosscutting cleavage configurations, which enable coethnics to hold membership in multiple groups, and opens up the possibility of future defection to the opposition along shared identity markers. In response, elites prefer coalitions that internalize crosscutting cleavages, as they restrict defections to coalition partners and survive longer. To test these hypotheses, I collected new data on linguistic, religious, and racial intragroup divisions. Using conditional choice models on formation opportunities in 134 ethnically divided societies between 1946 and 2009, I find that, independent of institutional rules, ethnic elites frequently opt for oversized multiethnic coalitions that share as many ethnic markers as possible. These coalitions survive longer than more heterogeneous pacts."
Judgment and Equality,"Many topics social scientists study are sensitive in nature. Although we know some people may be reluctant to respond to sensitive questions in surveys, we know less about how such questions could influence responses to other questions appearing later in a survey. In this study, we use the Trump administration’s proposal to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census to demonstrate how such spillover effects can undermine important survey-based estimates. Using a large survey experiment (n=9,035 respondents), we find that asking about citizenship status significantly increases the percentage of questions skipped and makes respondents less likely to report that members of their household are Hispanic. Not only does this demonstrate that sensitive questions can have important downstream effects on survey responses, but our results also speak to an important public policy debate that will likely arise in the future."
"Abortion as Gender Transgression: Reproductive Justice, Queer Theory, and Anti–Crisis Pregnancy Center Activism","The pursuit of world peace has long been part of the telos of modern anthropology, although this may not be particularly obvious in the discipline’s teaching on its history today. Taking Claude Lévi-Strauss’s essay on Jean-Jacques Rousseau as a key text, this article reviews how anthropology rose to prominence (post–World War II) as a vital body of knowledge in the making of a durable international peace."
"Uncertainty, Cleavages, and Ethnic Coalitions","We examine interest group involvement in Supreme Court nominations from 1930 to 2017, finding dramatic shifts in the number and type of groups, as well as their choice of tactics. Whereas the early period was dominated by labor unions, “core” civil rights groups, and groups affiliated with the “old right,” the modern period is dominated by public interest/citizen groups and “identity” groups. We also find a shift from more traditional “inside” tactics to the heavy use of “outside/grassroots” mobilization tactics. Finally, we show that the calculus of mobilization has increasingly been based on a nominee’s ideology over time."
"Sensitive Questions, Spillover Effects, and Asking about Citizenship on the US Census","This introductory essay outlines the overall aims of the symposium and provides a preview of each contribution. By pointing out specific tensions in the securitization field and unexplored areas of research, we aim to direct innovative and meaningful research for both securitization and wider areas of study. Shortcomings in the field that are outlined here include: unnecessary fault lines in securitization research that can possibly be overcome; the underexplored nature of the field; a failure to properly address the role of objects in research; the absence of substantial research on failed securitizations; and contradictions in research on the audience’s role in securitization. To address these shortcomings, the symposium offers contributions from Thierry Balzacq, Mark Salter, Rita Floyd, Jan Ruzicka, and Timothy Potenz, with a concluding article by Potenz and Ned Lebow."
Anthropology and world peace,"This symposium article aims to showcase the strengths of thinking ethically about securitization using the concept of “just securitization.” It poses the research question: When, if ever, are states required to securitize? I argue that using the just securitization concept leads to three rival answers, each modelled on competing interpretations of the just war tradition’s principle of “last resort.” The article examines the relative strengths and weaknesses of the literal strong last resort, ameliorated moderate last resort, and modified weak last resort principles. It then examines the validity of the three competing ethical stances regarding when states are morally required to securitize that can be generated from the respective interpretations of last resort. These ethical stances are: 1) securitization is never obligatory; 2) securitization is obligatory when it is necessary to achieving just cause; and 3) securitization is obligatory when it is expected to be the best option. While siding with the ethical stance contained within ameliorated moderate last resort, in which obligation remains tied to necessity, I caution that the utility of such a principle ultimately depends on intersubjective agreements among security scholars pertaining to definitions concerning, for example, the nature of viable alternatives to securitization."
To Promote the General Welfare: Why Madison Matters,"The literature on post-communist transitions has tended to conceptualize privatization with an emphasis on the state: private property is secure when the state surrenders its claims to ownership. This approach—though justified and often fruitful—is limited. Private property under capitalism is about more than the state. There are different forms of private property and not all of them characterize successful transitions to capitalism. Drawing on Marx’s Capital, I argue that a defining feature of private property under capitalism is the regulation of social relations between capital and labor. In contextualizing post-communism within historical transitions to capitalism, I seek to highlight the specificity of private property under capitalism and suggest that successful privatization is not the same as a successful transition to capitalism. Through a comparative study of land privatization in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, I claim that while privatization might be necessary for a transition to capitalism, it is not sufficient unless accompanied by peasant dispossession."
"From Textbook Pluralism to Modern Hyperpluralism: Interest Groups and Supreme Court Nominations, 1930–2017","In many ways, the contemporary Slow Food movement is the heir to the early twentieth-century Arts and Crafts movement. Both movements believe that democratic societies should restructure their economic systems so as to ensure that workers and consumers are able to experience pleasure. In this article, I examine how prominent advocates of artisanal crafts understand the relationship between democracy, economics, and pleasure. Drawing on the ideas of William Morris, Ellen Gates Starr, Carlo Petrini, Wendell Berry, and Barbara Kingsolver, I argue that democracy societies should encourage joyful labor and ensure universal access to material objects that enrich daily life. I also, however, conclude that democrats who are inspired by the Arts and Crafts and slow food movements must make more of an effort to ensure that their understanding of pleasure is inclusive."
Introduction: The Rationale and Constitution of this Symposium,"Historians are often allergic to ideas of collective pathology. I do not disagree at all with these objections and concerns. And yet, this paper stresses the centrality of the book The Authoritarian Personality because in addition to its problematic pathologizing tendencies, it also poses important challenges to the history of fascism, especially in terms of the latter’s periodization and its intellectual history. In other words, it is time to think with and about The Authoritarian Personality in the context of studies on fascism."
"Net-munity, or the Space between Us … Will Open the Future","Focusing on the work of New Negro performing artist Fredi Washington as a writer and activist during the 1930s and 1940s, this article places an African American female performing artist at the center of the narrative of the New Negro Renaissance, illuminates the vital influence of Black female performing artists on the movement, and demonstrates the ways in which Washington and the New Negro Renaissance are central components of the social transformation of twentieth-century America. Washington’s fusion of artistry and activism, her determination to fight oppression on myriad fronts and in myriad forms, casts her as an influential actor in the unremitting African American quest for civil and human rights. Her life and her work make visible the significance of the performing arts within the movement and enhance our understanding of the scope and texture of the activism of Black performing artists and of Black women. Her experience brings the Renaissance into the progressive movements of the early twentieth century and illuminates its role as a keystone in the foundation of the Black Freedom Movement."
Coriolanus and the Voice of Cynicism,"Authoritarian governments cultivate an image of popular support to legitimize their rule. One such strategy is to create the impression that their rule and policies are widely supported by the international community. In this study, I systematically explore how the Chinese Party-state uses foreign experts in its propaganda to provide extra legitimacy to Chinese government policies. I collected data on non-Chinese-national intellectuals cited in 31 major news outlets in China, from which I compiled a list of 723 foreign experts who were cited to provide positive evaluations of China. The experts were from 67 different countries but showed a clear US-centric focus. I identified five major issues that they most frequently were cited about and summarized their opinions. The findings of this study show a mixed picture of China’s propaganda strategy: It is sophisticated but also stilted in conforming to existing power structures. It enriches our understanding of how an authoritarian regime like China’s cultivates its image and shapes public opinion. It also draws attention to the social and ethical implications of the possible distortion and fabrication of expert opinions in the propaganda process."
"“To Stamp Out the Oppression of All Black People”: Ron Grayson and the Association of Black Gays, 1975–1979","Poland and Hungary are two European countries where populist parties govern without coalition partners. Such undiluted power has meant they could target the formal institutions of accountability—courts, news media, and oversight agencies—and the informal norms of democracy, including tolerance and forbearance, by attacking the opposition, dividing societies, and reconfiguring national memories to justify their policies. The result is the authoritarian backsliding of these post-communist democratic pioneers. Yet the populist parties remain relatively popular, largely thanks to generous, if selective, social policies."
"States, Last Resort, and the Obligation to Securitize","In opposition to the view, on the one hand, that suggestions that we are witnessing the rise of fascism are needlessly alarmist, and, on the other, that fascism is ubiquitous and coextensive with capitalism, Theodor W. Adorno understands fascism as neither decisively defeated in the Second World War, nor an all-pervasive reality. Rather, late capitalist societies evince fascist potential that, given the right concatenation of conditions, could re-emerge. As Adorno once argued, the real threat of fascism comes from within not from outside of capitalist or liberal democracy.2 In articulating such an assessment, Adorno offers an analysis that escapes the pitfalls of writers such as Corey Robin, who underestimates the threat, on the one hand, and those such as Deleuze, Guattari, and Foucault, for whom such a threat is all-pervasive, on the other."
The Planet: An Emergent Humanist Category,"This article focuses on the manipulation of legislative rules in electoral authoritarian states. Electoral liberalization in authoritarian regimes creates the capacity for opposition forces to win legislative seats, but it does not ensure voice in the policy process. While the literature on institutional authoritarianism points to co-optation, dominant parties, and redistribution as mechanisms to control policy outcomes in authoritarian legislatures, we investigate an additional possibility: that electoral authoritarian regimes (EARs) select legislative institutions that allow free debate and unconstrained voting yet decouple electoral success from policy influence. Our analysis centers on the EAR in Hong Kong and its legislature, the Legislative Council (LegCo). We find that the LegCo’s rules of procedure interact with electoral institutions to create considerable roadblocks to opposition initiatives, while at the same time facilitating the enactment of regime policies."
Privatization without Capitalism: The Social Relations of Property in Post-Communist Transitions,"This article contributes to the emerging literature on populist foreign policy by examining President Trump’s ability to dominate and shape public discourse on trade. We develop an ideational approach to populism that focuses on the social network that emerges surrounding a populist leader’s discourse. We hypothesize that populist leaders will generate a polarized social network along the elite-versus-people divide instead of the usual partisan boundary. Populist leaders like Trump are known to prefer direct, unmediated access to the people in order to spread their ideology. We therefore examine Trump’s use of Twitter as he announced his steel and aluminum tariffs in March 2018 and its impact on the salience and content of debates around trade policy on the Twittersphere. Our findings highlight how Trump and his supporters use populist foreign policy themes to articulate their policy positions on social media."
"The Citizen, the Baker, and the Candlestick Maker: What Democrats Can Learn from the Arts and Crafts and Slow Food Movements","Both mainstream and academic critics responded warmly to black queer film director Dee Rees’s 2011 film, Pariah. New York Times reviewer Stephen Holden hailed it as a universal coming-of-age drama, and academic critics praised the film’s “universal appeal,” citing it as an important “cinematic contribution” to a wider genealogy of black lesbian image making and a complex depiction of black queer womanhood. Few critics mentioned the 2007 short film that Rees had made using the same title and basic story. Thus, they made no mention of the transformation of protagonist Alike’s mother, Audrey, between the two versions. Where Audrey is strict, religious, and overprotective but ultimately redeemable in the short, she is irreparably homophobic and the central impediment’s to Alike’s gender and sexual freedom in the feature. The addition of the homophobic black maternal figure raises salient questions about Pariah specifically and the terms and conditions of contemporary black queer women’s popular cultural visibility generally. What are some of the racialized sexual logics underpinning Pariah? What function does the homophobic black maternal figure serve in contemporary black queer critical and cultural productions? Is black queer women’s popular cultural visibility predicated on the condemnation of black maternal figures, or of black communities more broadly, as sexually regressive? This essay takes Pariah as a departure point from which to examine the homophobic black maternal figure as an emergent archetype within contemporary black queer coming-out narratives, specifically in novels and films. I mobilize black lesbian feminist methodologies to suggest that this archetype serves as the basis for an eminent literary and cinematic genre that I theorize as the black queer liberation plot: neatly packaged black queer liberation narratives that predicate their protagonist’s sexual freedom on her flight from a central black maternal figure who often functions as a stand-in for a black community."
The Authoritarian Personality and the History of Fascism,"This article builds upon recent contributions to the growing literature on Tocqueville and race by exploiting underappreciated parallels in Tocqueville’s thought between European feudalism and American racial subordination. We show how four key features of Tocqueville’s conception of feudal aristocracy—heritability, membership, privilege, and exclusion—provide the foundation for an implicit account of white supremacy. In this way, we demonstrate that Tocqueville conceived of the United States as a racial aristocracy, specifically, an aristocracy of whiteness. By reconstructing Tocqueville’s structural account of white supremacy, we dispel the myth that he held a “prejudice” or “anomaly” theory of racism. Tocqueville’s views on race, therefore, have more in common with those of W. E. B. Du Bois and Charles Mills, for example, than Gunnar Myrdal. Finally, we explore the advantages of conceiving of whiteness as a form of aristocracy rather than property."
"“A Free America for All Peoples …”: Fredi Washington, the Negro Actors Guild, and the Voice of the People","This essay calls for a fresh look at Spenser’s relationship to Petrarch—one that moves past a reliance on commonplace notions of “Petrarchism” to consider what exactly the English poet may have learned from his Italian predecessor. It thus explores what it might mean to identify Spenser as “post-Petrarchan”: to love and rival Vergil, to engage in intense literary self-reflection and autobiographical self-presentation, to reach for an international, multilingual audience engaged in cross-cultural and transhistorical dialogue, and to transform the lyric from a relatively minor literary genre to one that sought epic amplitude."
Praise from the International Community: How China Uses Foreign Experts to Legitimize Authoritarian Rule,"This article envisions and details a critical framework we term feminist-of-color disability studies. In offering a feminist disability studies grounded in the genealogies of US feminist-of-color theory, we identify, challenge, and counter the tendency of feminist disability studies scholars to exclude the intellectual output of women and queers of color. We contend that feminists of color have long written and theorized on topics of illness, health, and disability, yet their vital insights remain largely disregarded by practitioners of feminist disability studies. Within the article, we detail critical methods and approaches essential to integrating race into feminist disability studies. Then, building upon Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s groundbreaking “Integrating Disability, Transforming Feminist Theory,” we identify and discuss what we name as the central domains of feminist-of-color disability studies: discourse, state violence, health/care, and activism. Overall, this article aims to trace an alternate lineage of feminist disability studies that centralizes the scholarship of feminists of color by identifying potential sites of analysis and opportunities for cross-pollination as well as providing a substantive foundation for future feminist-of-color disability studies scholarship across a variety of disciplines."
How Populists Rule: The Consequences for Democratic Governance,"Scholars and policy makers frequently advocate recruiting “embedded” bureaucrats with strong ties to citizens in order to improve service delivery. Yet, officials who are too embedded in their communities are often blamed for corruption, favoritism, and ineffectiveness. We argue that this ambiguity stems from a mismatch between individual- and community-level effects of embeddedness. While personal ties increase engagement between directly connected citizens and bureaucrats, a community-level increase in bureaucrats’ personal ties alienates unconnected citizens and undermines claims of impartiality. We test this argument on public safety provision in the Philippines. We measure family networks in 286 villages, locate police officers within those networks, and analyze citizen survey responses. Citizens are more willing to trust and engage with officers to whom they are more closely related. However, in villages where officers are highly embedded, unconnected citizens evaluate their performance more poorly. Consequently, village-level officer embeddedness is associated with higher rates of feuds and disputes."
How do People Become a Mass?,"On becoming paramount leader, Xi Jinping, with the assistance of Wang Qishan, augmented the powers of the Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDI), the body charged with investigating wrongdoing by government and Party employees. To consolidate his power, Xi merged a number of different departments into a “great system of supervision and investigation,” known as the National Supervisory Commission (NSC). The CDI acts as the core body of the NSC, and it scrutinizes cases of corruption and malfeasance in coordination with relevant departments. The most important aspects of this process are “placing a case on file” (li’an) and “detention” (liuzhi). This article seeks to throw light on the CDI’s investigation process through extensive fieldwork carried out in County J."
The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism by Catherine Rottenberg; Empowered: Popular Feminism and Popular Misogyny by Sarah Banet-Weiser,"Why are some countries more open to trade than others? Prominent explanations emphasize differences in the influence of voters as consumers. Consumers benefit from lower prices. Because governments in democracies are more responsive to voters, they should implement lower tariffs. We develop and evaluate an implication of this line of argument. If lower tariffs are a response to consumer interests, lower tariffs should be concentrated on products most relevant to consumers. Using data on consumption shares across product categories, we report evidence that consumer interests do not account for lower tariffs. Governments place higher tariffs on goods with higher consumption shares, and we find no evidence that this relationship attenuates under more democratic institutions. There may be a variety of reasons why more democratic states are engaged in higher levels of international trade. A larger concern for consumer interests, however, is likely not among them."
Legislative Rules in Electoral Authoritarian Regimes: The Case of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council,"Purpose: We examine policy influencers’ perceptions of the targets of school-choice policy across five states, exploring how constructions varied for White and racially minoritized families, whether policy actors conceived of the “target” of policy as the child or the parent, and how these racialized constructions varied across different types of school-choice policies. Research Methods/Approach: We conducted 56 semistructured interviews in 2019 with state-level stakeholders across five states. Findings: We found that policy actors generally viewed White families as strong and racially minoritized families as weak. However, for both groups, we found variation in whether these constructions were positive or negative and differences between students and parents. We find that social constructions are fluid, with varying, sometimes conflicting and contradictory views of racially minoritized and White parents in the same period, within the same state context. Despite the salience of race throughout social constructions of the target population, policy actors primarily used color-evasive references. In general, we found little variation in policy components at the state level. Implications: Our work demonstrates how racialized social constructions matter for equity in school-choice policy, with implications for local, state, and federal policy and for future research."
“I Am a Tariff Man”: The Power of Populist Foreign Policy Rhetoric under President Trump,"A famous proponent of solitude and self-reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson rejected the conformity of Jacksonian mobs and mass parties for solitary nature walks, and so has long been read as an antipolitical figure. Recent scholars have reinterpreted Emersonian self-reliance to include extralegal boycotts of slave-made goods and resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act. This essay takes these accounts a step further, arguing that Emerson saw that some forms of extralegal cooperative action were compatible with self-reliance. Specifically, self-reliance requires contemplating and then acting on personal moral rules. As Northern crowds rallied to rescue and harbor fugitive slaves, Emerson saw that joining an abolitionist crowd allowed unconventional debate and intellectual self-reliance and created a space to act on one’s personal principles, encouraging active self-reliance. Union enlistment similarly let free Blacks and antislavery Northerners enact their principles and achieve a measure of self-reliance. Paradoxically, self-reliance can sometimes be achieved through common action."
"Unpacking Pariah: Maternal Figuration, Erotic Articulation, and the Black Queer Liberation Plot","This introduction to the special issue “Temperance Past and Present” identifies the main themes of the articles and associated conference, gives a brief historiography of temperance, and surveys “new temperance.”"
The Abyssinian Prince: A History of Imposture and the Interwar United States,"This article reports responses to the IFLA’s school library guidelines by school librarians in South China. The IFLA’s 16 guidelines-based recommendations were presented to representatives of eight schools, and a workshop was organized in response to their feedback. Librarians and principals from 42 schools in Guangzhou assessed the guidelines both before and after the workshop. Most recommendations were considered applicable, but several areas were thought to be poorly suited to the Chinese situation. Many participants’ concerns about the relevance of the recommendations were allayed by the training provided during the workshop. However, the training not only informed the participating school librarians of the areas in which the recommendations were appropriate but also highlighted areas where they were not. In particular, participants felt that some elements of the recommendations were politically insensitive and that the lack of status of school librarians in China would make some of them impractical."
“Living as One Wishes” in Athens: The (Anti-)Democratic Polemics,"Drawing on participant observation at communal sites of genocide memory and ethnographic interviews with villagers, monks, and nongovernmental organization stakeholders, I longitudinally trace (over a five-year period) the localization of Euro-Western genocide commemoration in the Cambodian landscape. Hybrid Khmer-Western communal memorials that display victim remains and promote genocide pedagogy signify elite capitulation to Western cosmopolitan memory and reap the rewards of atrocity tourism. Despite the facade of successful localization, my data point to elite and nonelite resistance to cosmologically dangerous or semiotically meaningless commemorative practice and to the failure of hybrid memorialization. A close reading of Cambodian Buddhist conceptualizations of memory, commemoration, and relations between living and dead reveals how and why facades of localization culturally work to sustain simulacra of engaged universals, creating a “perfect failure” of global-local translation. My findings problematize the globalization of a Holocaust model of commemoration and the human right and duty to remember as a pillar of global genocide pedagogy in today’s postconflict memoryscapes. I consider implications for understandings of intercultural friction and the productive dynamism of global-local encounters while deconstructing contemporary anthropological frames that occlude critique of global-local engagement."
Further Reflections on Seeing Like a State,"The US welfare state provides key benefits indirectly. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), for example, uses a package including exchanges, subsidies, and penalties to increase health insurance enrollment. Prior research indicates that indirect policies do not produce feedback effects on public opinion, but the ACA was unusually salient and complex. Can such indirect policies produce feedback effects, and are any such effects heterogeneous? Here, we use several data sets and inferential strategies to show that groups especially affected by the exchanges and the associated insurance mandate did shift their ACA attitudes, albeit in opposing directions and with more limited effects than descriptive analyses suggest. Those who experienced rising local prices became more opposed to the ACA, while those who stood to benefit from some changes to the individual markets became more favorable. Overall, positive changes in attitudes were offset by demographically concentrated, negative shifts among the uninsured."
Aristocracy in America: Tocqueville on White Supremacy,"This work puts the current president’s efforts to deconstruct the administrative state (i.e., the agencies, people, and processes of the executive establishment) into context. Analogous to their neglect of the nation’s physical infrastructure, I explain why Congress and the president rarely have incentives to tend to the care and feeding of the departments and agencies of government, particularly the parts that provide few direct benefits to key electoral interests. I describe the health of the administrative state before Trump’s presidency to illustrate the cumulative effect of these incentives. I then turn to reviewing the Trump administration’s actions to deconstruct the administrative state. I illustrate how the president’s approach is consistent with the actions of previous presidents and how he departs, notably positioning himself as president but not chief executive. I conclude with implications for the quality of governance in the United States and some modest proposals for reform."
Spenser’s Petrarch,"This article provides a brief history of the inhumanities in both the East and the West. The term inhumanities gestures in two directions. Inhumanities refers first to humanistic texts and thinkers who provide “logical justifications” for dehumanizing human beings. The term also considers the logical justifications such texts and thinkers provide for disqualifying certain humans—for the purpose of this essay, slaves—from access to humanistic study. The article supposes that this history of the inhumanities is the long-standing first crisis in the humanities. With this in mind, it considers the reverberations of the history of the inhumanities in our current crisis in the humanities, and it concludes with a call to rethink the humanities in this contemporary moment of crisis."
"Integrating Race, Transforming Feminist Disability Studies","The “historic turn” marked a new era of convergence between anthropology and history. However, recent research proposes that this anthrohistorical field is informed by a latent cultural historicism. When studying historical consciousness and deploying history in analysis, theorists argue, we must clarify how historicism—the ideology and practices underpinning Western historical understanding—informs anthropological theory, or risk ethnocentrism. Historicist regimes of truth also demand anthropological study, given their pervasive influence in the social sciences and wider society. This article develops a comparative anthropology of historicism, drawing on historical anthropology and ethnographic fieldwork. First, I analyze the history practices of a network of leftist historians, the Forum-Histoire, based at l’Université de Paris VII, and their role in an influential protest movement against the state; second, I assess the work of a socialist public historian in his efforts to refashion historical consciousness in Mediterranean France. The article analyzes the role of historicism in French history practices and its conflict and synthesis with nonhistoricist ways of knowing the past during an influential period (1975–2005) for relations between history and anthropology. In a genealogical vein, this facilitates analysis of anthropology’s relationship to historicism and indicates how to better deploy historicist analysis within anthropological discourse."
"Spokesmen, Spies, and Spouses: Anticolonialism, Surveillance, and Intimacy in Interwar France","In this revised text of the 2018 Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture, we encounter two communities—one a village in highland Crete, the other a small enclave in the old core of Bangkok—against which bureaucratic forces have exercised disproportionate violence, claiming to do so in response to what are openly admitted to be infractions of formal law. The particularly harsh punishments meted out to these communities, in contrast to what has happened to other, otherwise similarly insubordinate local groups, calls for a specific explanation. This would seem to lie at least partly in the residents’ tactic of subversive archaism, in which residents, through a variety of performative acts, challenge the moral authority of bureaucracies modeled on Western prototypes and imbued with Western-derived and middle-class notions of order and style. While other elements (such as shifts in the distribution of patronage) may shed light on the selective character of the state’s reprisals, the threat that subversive archaism poses to the cultural legitimacy of state and municipal bureaucracies emerges as a broader way of accounting for the official deployment of violence against groups of people whose flamboyant traditionalism ostensibly represents them as the most fundamentally loyal citizens of all."
Family Matters: The Double-Edged Sword of Police-Community Connections,"What types of foreign policy cues are most likely to turn public opinion against a popular emerging norm? Since 2017, the US government has sought to discredit the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and its nuclear nonpossession norm among the largely prodisarmament American public. We fielded a national US survey experiment (N=1,219) to evaluate the effects of these elite cues as well as social group cues on public opinion. Our study thus offers one of the first experimental assessments of public attitudes toward nuclear disarmament. We find that both negative government messages and group cues can shift attitudes. Direct exposure to official rhetoric—particularly substantive security and institutional critiques—most effectively increases opposition to the norm. Yet, we observe that all cues have little effect on respondents’ existing opposition to nuclear arms. The American population may support eventually eliminating nuclear weapons, but majority backing for immediate disarmament appears far from assured."
"Strengthening China’s Powerful Commission for Discipline Inspection under Xi Jinping, with a Case Study at the County Level","The control of microbes in food has been as important to human societies as the domestication of plants and animals. The direct or indirect management of microbes has been critical to food safety, ensuring nutrient availability, and developing desired sensory characteristics in food. Fermentation is more universal than is agriculture inasmuch as it is practiced by agricultural societies, pastoralists, and hunter-gatherers. In addition, fermentation likely predates agriculture, potentially by hundreds of thousands of years. However, we lack a general approach to understanding of (a) when and why technologies associated with fermentation emerged and (b) how those technologies and the microbes associated with them diverged once they emerged. Here we offer a framework for the study of the diversification of fermented foods in and among human societies. In developing this framework, we draw heavily from research on language and more generally cultural diversification."
The Absence of Consumer Interests in Trade Policy,"As an analytic and an object of study, disability provides a powerful lens to refocus and potentially transform thinking about new and enduring concerns shaping contemporary anthropology. At its most basic, the recognition of disability as a universal social fact helps us to understand the cultural specificities of personhood and to reconsider the unstable boundaries of the category of the human. This special issue of Current Anthropology is based on a 2018 Wenner-Gren international symposium on disability addressing this underrepresented area of research. The articles published here demonstrate the transformative value of critical anthropological studies of disability for many of our discipline’s key questions regarding kinship, biopolitics, the life course, inequality/racism, war and violence, technology and materiality, and the importance of disability to decolonizing perspectives in anthropology."
Social Construction Is Racial Construction: Examining the Target Populations in School-Choice Policies,This essay examines the fallout from a 1979 proposal by the National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF) to legalize marijuana production and commerce in Colombia as a strategy to reduce the violence stemming from the eradication and interdiction campaign taking place on the country’s Caribbean coast. The essay proposes a new perspective to the study of the “war on drugs” by decentering its history from domestic disputes within the United States and following instead the networks of exchange and debate running between Washington and Bogotá. I argue that ANIF’s effort in the late 1970s to articulate a less punitive solution to the illicit drug traffic prompted a conservative backlash in both countries that strengthened the forces that insisted on the need to militarize drug policy in the Americas. This new consensus worked against President Carter’s agenda toward decriminalization and harm reduction; acted to silence the voices calling for a tolerant approach; and ultimately helped pave the way for Colombia to become the principal anti-narcotics laboratory of the Americas in the 1980s and 1990s.
"Rethinking Self-Reliance: Emerson on Mobbing, War, and Abolition","The deeply prudential nature of James Madison’s statesmanship has frequently been noted but never sufficiently explored. Prudence, for Madison, meant that an individual should support imperfect (even bad) policies when these were the best practicable—an outlook that complicates assessment of Madison’s thought, leaving substantial space between principle and action. Thus, Madison resisted immediate emancipation not because of doubt about antislavery principles but because he believed that it would practically benefit neither society nor newly freed slaves. Madison’s prudential outlook is of particular relevance to assessing his constitutionalism. Madison’s crusade for proportional representation in the Constitutional Convention—frequently portrayed as an ideologically driven failure of prudential vision—was a carefully calculated maneuver to maintain the union. Of even greater interest, Madison’s willingness to override principle for the greater good extended to one of his most fundamental principles—that constitutional limits on government must be respected."
Temperance Past and Present: Thoughts on Radical Temperance,"This essay reframes the significance of the Authoritarian Personality study for the “fascism debates” and for the rapidly growing field of research on digitally mediated right-wing movements by rereading Theodor Adorno as a theorist of algorithms. Positing that the advent of “the society of algorithms” has transformed the nature of both authoritarianism and of personality, it returns to two empirical texts where Adorno analyzes two methods of classification and prediction: the “Types and Syndromes” chapter of The Authoritarian Personality, and Adorno’s content analysis of the Los Angeles Times astrology column, Stars Down to Earth. On the basis of these texts, this essay formulates some initial hypotheses about certain widely observed changes in the character of the right and sketches a program for a critical data science inspired by Adorno’s “critical typology” that could undertake further investigation. Finally, it proposes the “systems update” as a concept useful for understanding the relationship of contemporary right-wing movements to both digital media and historical fascism."
On the Applicability of IFLA Standards in Different Local Contexts: The Case of IFLA School Library Guidelines in China,"The price of Bitcoin is once more soaring. From early October 2020 to early January 2021, the price of a single Bitcoin token went from roughly $10,000 to nearly $65,000, reinspiring the hopes of the crypto-faithful in the inevitability of a future beyond centralized banking and leaving the rest to dread the jargon of computational libertarianism. The speculative betting driving this recent price action, however, belies a more rudimentary and overlooked shift in the digital economy signaled by cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular. Unlike an earlier industrial logic that sought to reduce heat loss and improve efficiency to maximize surplus value, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system shifts the basis of value production from efficiency to inefficiency. Moreover, it does so by using a cryptographic algorithm whose purpose is to destroy the meaning of its inputs. Through an exploration of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work technics and its inversion of traditional models of value extraction, the text argues that Bitcoin reveals a profound transformation in the nature of surplus represented by computational capitalism."
The “Perfect Failure” of Communal Genocide Commemoration in Cambodia Productive Friction or “Bone Business”?,"From the democratic peace to the authoritarian peace to the conflict-prone behavior of democratizing states, empirical evidence shows that regime types influence the decision to go to war. The only way distinct regimes can behave differently in similar circumstances is if they have different tastes for settlements. Moreover, dyadic negotiation is dependent on the regime types of both participants. Here we offer a dyadic theory of conflict where states bargain over a good with different attributes: a club good element and an element of private goods like rents. We show that dyad type has important effects on the potential for conflict. Empirically, we show our new predictions about the dependence of conflict on dyad type—namely, the presence of private goods in an international crisis increases the likelihood of violence when both sides are autocratic but decreases it when one side is sufficiently democratic."
"Moishe Postone’s Historical Time: Capital, the Holocaust, and Jewish Marxism","Some scholars critique American exceptionalism as a proud, uncritical orientation. In this article, however, I argue that Frederick Douglass, an outspoken social critic, qualifies as an American exceptionalist thinker. I first identify and theorize two modes of exceptionalist rhetoric: accomplished exceptionalism, which is self-celebratory and largely uncritical, and aspirational exceptionalism, which is self-critical and reflective. I then provide a close reading of “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July” to show how Douglass employs aspirational rhetorical techniques. Finally, I discuss the benefits of reading Douglass as an exceptionalist thinker and suggest that his aspirational rhetoric activates reflective and progressive modes of American citizenship."
Offsetting Policy Feedback Effects: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act,"Although the dynamics of capital are various, one dynamic is inescapably psychical. In this article, I argue in favor of a concept of what I call “primal capital,” in which capital is not only a “factor of production” but also consists of psychical processes. I proceed by way of reconstructing John Maynard Keynes’s account in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936) of the owner of capital’s “propensity to hoard.” Keynes presents a model of psychical conflict under epistemic conditions of uncertainty, in which the owners of capital are perpetually torn between hoarding capital in the money form and long-term investment in wealth-generating economic production. To develop the psychical content of capital, I explore resonances between Keynes’s account of hoarding and Freud’s account of obsessional neurosis."
The Supreme Court’s Challenge to Civil Society,"During the second half of the long Australian nineteenth century (ca. 1840–1914), drugs were subjected to increasing government control in a process largely driven by the temperance movement. Temperance activism and its highly public campaign against alcohol were the key to a profound shift in the social imaginary of drugs—the common understanding of intoxicating substances—which were converted from symbols of individual deviance to the structural cause of social problems. The temperance movement promoted the disease concept of addiction and lobbied governments for expanded controls on alcohol, a model that was later copied by critics of opium. But more importantly, temperance and its radical attack on alcohol as a problem in itself inspired a fundamental shift in the public discourse about drugs that paved the way for modern drug prohibition. This article uses a series of government inquiries into alcohol and opium to illustrate their transformation into problem substances by the early twentieth century."
Deconstructing the Administrative State,"Intended to contrast with the Nazi-hosted Olympics of 1936, the Munich Olympics of 1972 provide a useful cultural site for analyzing West German narratives about the Nazi past and the democratic present in the “Long 1960s.” This article examines the press response to Munich’s successful bid; certain elements of the planning; an Olympic-eve ceremony of public mourning at the concentration camp in Dachau (a Munich suburb); and the responses of officials, electronic media, and Jewish Germans to the murder by Palestinian operatives of Jewish Israeli athletes. This evidence complicates binary conceptualizations of West German memory culture, such as self-imputed victimhood versus contrition, youthful indignation versus mainstream complacency, evasiveness versus earnestness, and the alleged movement of the Nazi past from oblivion to obsession. According to some historians, Chancellor Willy Brandt’s election in 1969 marked a fresh public readiness to embrace a culture of contrition. Others see the 1960s/70s as a time of bifurcation between the indifferent and the indignant. Differing from both schools of thought, this article suggests the dominance in this period of a distinct master narrative, “redemptive rehabilitation through transformative reconstruction.” Exemplified by the Olympics but wider in relevance, “transformative reconstruction” involved both acknowledging and erasing the Nazi past and framed the two as complementary. Although these efforts to displace the past sometimes operated as an evasion, they also generated unexpectedly earnest bouts of memory work. The Olympics thereby enable us to see what is elsewhere more obscure: that there was an intense internal codependency between oblivion and obsession."
A Brief History of the Inhumanities,"Richard Epstein has long defended classical liberalism, property rights, and                     private ordering, including the presumption that a patent owner deserves an                     injunction against ongoing infringement. We agree with Epstein that injunctions                     should be a presumptive remedy for infringement, but we have reservations about                     his consequentialist, law and economics justification for this position. Law and                     economics justifications struggle to explain why the state may use coercion and                     the implied threat of force to enforce policies written into law. By contrast,                     rights-based justifications can supply such an explanation, and we illustrate by                     showing how a Lockean theory of rights based in a metaethics of flourishing                     (eudaimonism) justifies both a patent and an injunctive remedy for violations of                     a patent. We also address misconceptions that Epstein and other                     consequentialists hold toward rights-based justifications: that such                     justifications make policy prescriptions without considering social consequences                     and that they are not as determinate as consequentialist justifications."
"History’s Impasse: Radical Historiography, Leftist Elites, and the Anthropology of Historicism in Southern France","Do some types of voters vote more strategically than others? We examine this question using a large survey in Canada that asked respondents to rate not just parties and party leaders but also local candidates. Using a new technique for combining multiple preference measures into a single utility estimate, we find that better educated voters and richer voters vote more strategically, as do women and older voters (although the latter two differences are smaller). Together with recent evidence from the United Kingdom, these results suggest that (at least in multicandidate first-past-the-post elections) the same types of voters who are more likely to turn out are also more likely to make their votes count."
What is a polity?: Subversive archaism and the bureaucratic nation-state,"This essay reveals that infrastructure, both transit and legal, not only facilitates exchanges across distance and borders, but also creates public structures of feeling. By structures of feeling, I refer to Raymond Williams’s discussion of those emergent trajectories of emotions that prevail without being fully articulated in a particular time and space. I found the term structures of feeling useful to articulate those emergent forms of mistrust, repulsion, anger, and even apprehension among the population with regard to the subway and other border-crossing projects."
"Antinormative Messaging, Group Cues, and the Nuclear Ban Treaty","Framing the Baltic Sea region (BSR) as caught between European Union discourses, Russian influence, and the region’s own identity dynamics, I build arguments around various contestations of these issues. Not all of the initial plans of the European Union and NATO regarding the future of region building in this part of Europe lived up to initial expectations, given the unexpected conflicts and ruptures after the end of the Cold War. My analysis aims to critically revise the main concepts that have shaped the discourses and policy practices of regionalism in Baltic Europe since the early 1990s. Responding to the main questions raised in the symposium, I claim that the post-Cold War combination of the European Union’s liberal normativity and post-modernist discourses failed to secure regional coherence, which explains the current trends toward the increasing fragmentation and division of Baltic Sea regionalism into three fields: good governance, energy projects, and security. Only the first of these three is grounded in adherence to liberal norms and principles."
"Guillaume Le Blanc and Fabienne Brugère, La fin de l’hospitalité: Lampedusa, Lesbos, Calais … jusqu’où irons-nous?","Conventional wisdom suggests that judicial legitimacy should be relatively unaffected by satisfaction with the ideological direction of judicial policy making. Recent studies challenge this assertion. The key to resolving this conundrum is estimating individual-level satisfaction with the ideological direction of judicial policy making reliably and validly. We examine the accuracy of several common measures of the concept. We find that 40% of the respondents repudiate their own scores on these measures. With this much systematic measurement error in such an important independent variable, the question of whether the Supreme Court’s institutional legitimacy is conditional on ideological agreement with its decisions must be reexamined."
Toward a Global Ecology of Fermented Foods,"Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945) is among the most successful examples of state building in the modern era. It is also a case where success was unlikely: Taiwan was an ethnically divided and violent frontier region of the Qing empire, where heavily armed communities had resisted attempts by rulers to exert control over their affairs for centuries. Unable to obtain the willing cooperation of community leaders in substantiating government authority within the locality, Japanese officials nevertheless succeeded at state building by transforming traditional institutions of state-society mediation into disciplinary instruments, thereby compelling community leaders to act against their own interests and aid in the realization of Japan’s modernist reforms. The case of colonial Taiwan has broad implications. It demonstrates what it actually would take to succeed at state building within the contexts and conditions commonly found in today’s ungoverned and undergoverned spaces, and it problematizes the prevailing notion that state building by imposition is compatible with liberalizing and democratizing reforms."
Disability/Anthropology: Rethinking the Parameters of the Human: An Introduction to Supplement 21,"The United States led the initial steps toward global prohibition in the early years of the twentieth century in part in order to support prohibition in the Philippines (1908) and the rest of the United States (1914). These steps occurred despite the variety of opinions about the legitimacy of recreational and medicinal marijuana in Europe and Asia. The US policy set precedents that would come to fruition as the war on drugs in later years, including emphasis on source control rather than treatment, efforts to internationalize the prohibition of narcotics, and reliance on intelligence services and secret police tactics to enforce the law. These policies shaped law enforcement, policing, medical practice, and public health policy in the United States and Philippines alike."
“Legalización o Represión”: How a Debate in Colombia Steered the Fate of the “War on Drugs”,"The annual Eranos conference in Ascona, Switzerland, contributed immensely to discourse about religion and spirituality from its inception in 1933. These gatherings, which revolved largely around the psychologist Carl Jung, investigated religious consciousness by way of spiritual “symbols” or “archetypes.” Such images were generally treated as timeless, autonomous phenomena that penetrate beyond historical particularities and social forms into the transcendent depths of the mystical Self. Discourse at Eranos thus portrayed the essence of religion as decontextualized and de-ethicized. The current article demonstrates that the German-Jewish philosopher Martin Buber was already sensitive to the sociopolitical dangers of this approach when he lectured at Eranos in 1934. The essay that emerged out of those talks, “Sinnbildliche und sakramentale Existenz im Judentum” (Symbolic and Sacramental Existence in Judaism), is widely read as a classic of Buber’s writings on Hasidism. And yet, the historical details surrounding Buber’s Eranos lectures, especially as evidenced in the unpublished letters between him and the conference organizer, Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, as well as the stenographer’s typescript of Buber’s live orations, shed remarkable new light on the well-known essay. “Sinnbildliche und sakramentale Existenz” was, in fact, composed largely as a polemic against Jung and his followers at Eranos, a number of whom were aligned with National Socialism and other fascist movements. In an act of scholarly resistance, Buber challenged widespread perspectives at Eranos regarding symbolism, Gnosticism, and the nature of religion. In so doing, he anticipated later critiques of Eranos that took shape in the 1990s."
"Not in the Room Where It Happens: Adversariness, Politicization, and Little Sisters of the Poor","Abstract values often motivate doctrines in important areas of constitutional law. A jurist favors one doctrinal position over another because, under some implicit positive theory, it promotes a consequential value, such as liberty or democratic values. Yet this jurisprudential posture falters if theory is incomplete or inapt. As an object lesson into the perils of incomplete functionalism, I consider the relationship between the so-called unitary executive and democratic values. I acknowledge a theoretical account of the unitary executive along the lines of the one that animates judicial decisions; I then argue that, viewed in a more complete setting, judicial decisions seemingly promoting a unitary executive may engender pluralism and undermine the value of accountability. A state-level empirical analysis of this issue questions the soundness of democratic values as a motivation for pursuing a unitary executive. I conclude with thoughts on the role of courts in managing functionalist constitutional values."
Against Every General Principle: Prudence in the Constitutional Statesmanship of James Madison,"We examine how voters form expectations about the policy positions of coalition governments. The literature generally assumes that voters believe the influence of coalition parties on government policy is proportional to the coalition parties’ sizes. Yet little is known about whether, or how, voters form such expectations. In this article we leverage data from Austria, Germany, and Sweden and find that voters do not see coalition party influence as proportional. Voters take account of the coalition parties’ bargaining strength, perceiving smaller coalition parties to have disproportional influence on coalition policy. In other words, voters who live under and vote for coalition governments have a somewhat different sense of policy outcomes than the literature currently suggests."
The Authoritarian Personality 2.0,"In recent decades, scholarship in the history of science has explored the emergence and development of sciences in which fields serve as privileged sites of knowledge production. Much of this work has focused on the field sciences’ formative period from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, and it is the definitions of the field, fieldwork, and field science emerging from the study of this period that have come to dominate the historical literature. Those definitions cannot, however, account for transformations that have taken place across many field sciences since the mid-twentieth century. Examining a diverse set of disciplines and contexts, the contributions to this Focus section reveal the specific conceptual and material contours of fields, fieldwork, and field sciences during this more recent period and suggest a number of unanswered questions and topics for future research."
The Bolshevik Revolution Is Over,"The humanities have had a frustrating share in the inhumanities committed in the name of humanism. Scientific racism and African studies as kith and kin of colonialism and Maafa are just the tip of the iceberg. We need to revisit this history critically and with visions of what the new humanities should look like. In doing so, unlike Bridges, the article acknowledges the rich efforts of “critical humanities” as displayed within gender, postcolonial, disability, and posthuman studies. Thus framed, the article will delve into a genealogical rereading of Western humanism and its humanities that bridges antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and the longevity of the futures thereof. In doing so, it will focus on the entanglement of humanism/humanity and colonialism/racism, while starting off from a posthumanist complication of the culture/nature divide."
From Work to Proof of Work: Meaning and Value after Blockchain,"The two works under review return to the founders to better understand the nature and limits of the American experiment as pessimism about its future has grown. Thomas E. Ricks’s First Principles: What American Founders Learned from the Greeks and Romans and How That Shaped Our Country examines how the thinking of the first four presidents was shaped by their historical understandings. Dennis C. Rasmussen’s Fears of a Setting Sun: The Disillusionment of America’s Founders also focuses on four leading founders but illuminates how they came to lose faith in the American experiment. These intelligent works reveal both the virtues and shortcomings of the American experiment, as well as illustrating that the founders had a deeper sense of the fragility of their experiment–and an acute understanding of constitutional imperfection–than their progeny have often had. Understanding this fragility might better help us preserve the future of the American experiment."
Hierarchical Oversight and the Value of Public Office: Evidence from Colonial Peru.,"In studies of voting behavior, racial resentment has consistently been associated with decreased support for black candidates. In this article we bring together a unique collection of observational data and survey experiments to show how, in the certain contexts, exactly the opposite occurs: racially resentful voters prefer to vote for a black candidate over a white competitor. Higher levels of racial resentment do not imply an unyielding opposition to black candidates because such voters respond to partisan and ideological cues about the preferences of black candidates. Because the traditional measure of racial resentment captures more than just racial animus, some black candidates—most notably, Republicans with an individualist message—benefit electorally from higher levels of racial resentment in the electorate. These results highlight the importance of campaign context in shaping how voters respond to racial, partisan, and ideological cues."
"Dyadic Conflict: Elites, Citizens, and War","The remains of the comic poet Theopompus suggest an author preoccupied with Homer: three of twenty titles reference the Odyssey (Odysseus, Penelope, Sirens), a fragment without title shows Odysseus talking about Homer, and even in the otherwise politically oriented The Mede we find hexameters and Homeric formulae. This article examines Theopompus’ approach to paraepic comedy, arguing that his fragments show sophisticated parody, early literary criticism, and a delight in anachronism and in the humor of quotation. Paraepic had fallen out of fashion in Aristophanes’ day, but I argue that Theopompus’ works provided a bridge between the early Homeric comedies of Epicharmus and Cratinus and the rebirth of paraepic in the later fourth century."
York’s Jesus: Crowned King and Traitor Attainted,"A number of explanations have been advanced for why soldiers commit acts of sexual violence in wartime, yet we have little understanding of why some rebels refrain from sexual violence. We examine the systematic absence of sexual violence by certain rebel groups, using original data on rebel leader selection practices coupled with data on sexual violence from the Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict project. We find strong quantitative support for our claim that leader selection processes hold significant consequences for engagement in sexual violence: rebels who choose leaders via an electoral process are less likely to engage in sexual violence in wartime. Moreover, we find that the degree of electoral inclusiveness significantly affects whether rebels commit sexual violence. Rebel groups that hold elections with civilian participation are significantly less likely to use sexual violence than groups whose leader elections occur only among group members or top-level rebel officials."
National Commemoration in an Age of Transnationalism,"Algorithmically driven online dating platforms today promise the ability to sort through relevant data and identify one’s ideal amorous matches effectively. Yet the appeal of technological and scientific solutions to the messy problem of finding partners is hardly new. This introduction to the Focus section “It’s a Match!” argues that the history of amorous matching has long been part and parcel of the history of science, in particular the social sciences. Taking matching as an “applied science of social harmony,” the authors argue that concern over more reliable techniques for determining the suitability of partners has formed an essential part of both the maintenance of social order and the shaping of subjectivities, enabling discourses of informed choice and the rational management of the passions, while also reinforcing and subverting structures of age, gender, race, and sexuality."
Blasting Reproach and All-Pervading Light: Frederick Douglass’s Aspirational American Exceptionalism,"This article explores the duty to vote under electoral autocracy. Using original survey data from Russia, I present evidence that most voters feel an ethical obligation—a civic duty—to vote. I suggest that the duty to vote under autocracy is rooted not in norms of democratic participation but rather in reverence for the state. Because autocratic regimes often penetrate and politicize the state, I argue that opposition voters are less likely to revere the state and less likely than regime supporters to believe that voting is a civic duty. Using a previously validated measure of the duty to vote, I find evidence in Russia consistent with these arguments. The theory and findings suggest that authoritarian incumbents have an inherent mobilizational advantage: their supporters feel a duty to vote, but regime opponents do not. This may help explain why opposition parties under autocracy find it hard to turn out their supporters."
Primal Capital,"How can coalition cabinets make policy decisions if the policy preferences of the coalition partners are private information? We use a mechanism design approach to study the important process of coalition governance in this setting. We show that, among all possible mechanisms that could structure decision making within a coalition government, the mechanism that leads to the “best” policy compromise among coalition partners when members’ preferences are private information is “constrained ministerial government.” This gives each particular cabinet minister considerable policy-making power within her policy jurisdiction, subject however to the key constraint that other cabinet members maintain some control by setting a bound on how far policy can be changed from the status quo. Our analysis develops a systematic account of what is gained and lost by using any given decision-making procedure and of what types of “compromise” are feasible or desirable when public policy is made by coalitions."
Problem Substances: Temperance and the Control of Addictive Drugs in Nineteenth-Century Australia,"In this article I examine the unfolding—within and beyond a court of law—of two relatively recent litigations initiated by Afrodescendants, in which two different antidiscrimination legal instruments provided the grounding for the cases’ “resolutions.” The argument suggests that contemporary ethnoracial legal instruments have failed to interrupt the reproduction of structural racism, or of what Tanya Hernández has called “race regulation customary law.” One of the lessons of this essay is certainly to point to anti-Black racism’s resilience, as it transforms itself as needed to better survive in also changing sociopolitical configurations. The essay uncovers the continuing operations of the Ecuadorian racial order in the very spaces and situations—the courtrooms of the justice system and beyond—where it is supposed to be combated, frontally. It reveals the inadequacy of contemporary antidiscrimination legal instruments to deal more holistically with the many facets of the situation and impacts of anti-Black racism and race regulation customary law on Afrodescendants’ affects and emotions, and the making and remaking of their precarity."
Murder and Memory at the Munich Olympics,"When authorities repress insurgents, does it quell their rebellion? Classic approaches to this question yielded inconsistent results because they sought to generalize repressive effects without accounting for the practices repressed. This article proposes that insurgent practices that draw allied support in a given historic context evade the de-escalatory capacity of repression. The article assesses the effects of repression on odds of remobilization for various forms of Black insurgent practice in the postwar United States, comparing the impact on civil rights protests and urban uprisings between 1954 and 1992, before checking final models on out-of-sample data. Generalizing the dynamics of practice better accounts for the evidence, transcending invariant models to explain social process without devolving to ideographic analysis."
"Patent Injunctions, Economics, and Rights","Government accountability is severely lacking in many developing countries, yet we know relatively little about the causal dynamics that produce citizen demands for greater responsiveness. We argue that a sense of ownership over public money heightens expectations for government services and induces expressive demands for accountability, and we apply the new theory in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from a series of lab-in-the-field experiments in Uganda and Ghana and from a nationally representative survey-based field experiment in Uganda all demonstrate that higher feelings of ownership over public revenues significantly increase citizens’ accountability pressures on leaders. Furthermore, simple interventions can significantly increase feelings of revenue ownership over oil and aid windfalls, producing demands for accountability indistinguishable from taxes."
The Noise of Neighbors: An Essay on “The Blacksmiths” and Unrelated Matters,"Can leveraging family history reduce xenophobia? Building on theories of group identity, we show that a family history of forced relocation leaves an imprint on future generations and can be activated to increase sympathy toward refugees. We provide evidence from Greece and Germany, two countries that vividly felt the European refugee crisis, and that witnessed large-scale forced displacement of their own populations during the twentieth century. Combining historical and survey data with an experimental manipulation, we show that mentioning the parallels between past and present differentially increases pledged monetary donations and attitudinal measures of sympathy for refugees among respondents with forcibly displaced ancestors. This differential effect is also present among respondents without a family history of forced migration who live in places with high historical concentration of refugees. Our findings highlight the role of identity and shared experience for reducing out-group discrimination."
Do We Live in a Society?,"This article uses new data measuring gradations of personalism in authoritarian regimes to evaluate the relationship between concentration of power and patterns of repression. It shows that the personalization of power in dictatorships leads to an increase in repression and, thus, a decrease in respect for human rights. Given the rise in personalism we are witnessing globally, the findings of this study imply that repression is likely to become more prevalent in dictatorships as a consequence."
"Fake News, Fact Checking, and Partisanship: The Resilience of Rumors in the 2018 Brazilian Elections","Dictators come to power with the support of elites who are also capable of removing them from power. If autocrats successfully navigate this critical period, they are more likely to survive in power with time. Yet their persistence in office alone does not reveal how they have managed to survive. Survival in power is the result of two distinct arrangements. In one, power remains balanced between the leader and the elite, and in the other, leaders are able to marginalize their supporting elites, enabling them to concentrate power. To determine whether power is shared or consolidated, we must look more directly at the behavior of dictators: their actions toward personnel and institutions that can shift the balance of power between themselves and elites. We use an item response model to produce a time series cross-sectional measure of the leader’s concentration of power for all nondemocracies from 1946 to 2008."
Family History and Attitudes toward Out-Groups: Evidence from the European Refugee Crisis,"While philanthropy is seen as a critical instrument for wealth redistribution in countries with low state capacity or weak welfare institutions, there is little empirical evidence of its distributional consequences. What are the incentives of the rich to philanthropically invest in local public goods? How do these incentives shape inequalities in access to services across ethnic and social groups? I answer these questions by exploiting the fact that fountains in Ottoman Istanbul, a city with rigid religious and social cleavages, were built by the Muslim elite’s private initiatives through the waqf system. Using data on water provision from 1868, I find that elites used philanthropy to benefit themselves disproportionately. Elite neighborhoods were more likely to have water access and had more fountains. Also, Muslim communities were better endowed than non-Muslim communities. I conclude that philanthropy can reproduce or even exacerbate inequalities in access to essential services."
Economic Theory without Historicity: The Relevance of Marxian Social Theory for a Critique of Capitalism,"Shakespeare’s portraits of hunger undermine the familiar link of sovereignty and emergency by asserting the necessary role of the collective in times of emergency. In his imaginative representations of the crisis of hunger, Shakespeare reveals a story beyond jurisdictional lines and national sovereignty, instead offering portraits of hunger expressed through a global perspective. In what I call Shakespeare’s hunger plays, this global understanding is not spatial, spanning national boundaries to consider hunger comparatively or territorially. Rather, his plays are “global” in the sense that they articulate a communal, even universal human condition. Characters meditate philosophically on the universality of hunger, using their pain to connect imaginatively to others, across time and space generally. Shakespeare’s characters turn to such global meditations on hunger in part because their conditions are stateless. In exile, banished from their homes, these characters gesture toward a law of nations, even without the precise language, coming out of Aquinas and adopted by Francisco de Vitoria in the sixteenth century, for ius gentium."
Personalization of Power and Repression in Dictatorships,"In dominant-party regimes, party cadres’ participation in decision making constrains dictators from arbitrarily changing policy. Dominant-party regimes are also better at mobilizing supporters in exchange for extensive patronage. The conventional wisdom is that these two mechanisms work together to prolong dominant-party regimes. However, under certain conditions, the elite-level constraints restrict autocratic leaders’ ability to engage in patronage distribution. We focus on monetary institutions, arguing that when central bank independence overlaps with the collective decision making in dominant-party regimes, dictators have diminished control over the central bank. Thus, the central bank is effective enough to restrict expansionary fiscal policy, reducing the mobilization of supporters through patronage and increasing authoritarian breakdown risk. Analyses on data from 1970 to 2012 in 94 autocracies find that high central bank independence in dominant-party regimes increases the likelihood of breakdown. Moreover, independent central banks in party-based autocracies contribute to lower fiscal expenditures."
Measuring the Consolidation of Power in Nondemocracies,"Cayo Honorato explores how questions of language, authorship, artistic autonomy and the performative are implicated in Sonia Boyce's turn towards participatory art."
Distributional Consequences of Philanthropic Contributions to Public Goods: Self-Serving Elite in Ottoman Istanbul,"Dummy variable maximum likelihood estimation for binary response panel models struggles to estimate coefficients or substantive quantities in either short or rare event panels. The standard response is a conditional maximum likelihood that consistently estimates the coefficients on time-varying covariates but makes substantive effects impossible to compute. In light of this problem, multiple suggestions have appeared for computing these effects, but there is little to no guidance as to when one solution may be preferred to another. I address this question by comparing one of these approaches, a correlated random effects estimator, to the maximum likelihood dummy variable estimator. I find that when the number of within-group observations is small or events are rare, the correlated random effects estimator is preferred, but as panels get longer the difference between approaches fades."
Invisible things,"On September 27, 1915, an unprecedented exhibition featuring more than 150 works by ninety women opened at a prestigious New York gallery, with half the proceeds designated to support the suffrage movement. Participants included painters Theresa Bernstein, Charlotte Coman, Adelaide Deming, Jane Freeman, and Agnes Pelton, illustrator Rose O’Neill, and sculptors Helena Smith Dayton, Abastenia St. Leger Eberle, Alice Morgan Wright, and Enid Yandell. The Archives of American Art’s Macbeth Gallery scrapbook serves as the primary record of the show. Drawing from art history, social history, and cultural and archival studies, this essay demonstrates how to use sparse sources to illuminate an underdocumented moment in women’s history."
States of Emergency: Hunger in Shakespeare,"What explains the sharp divide in European public attitudes toward Grexit? We explore this question using original surveys from four of the largest European economies. We contend that differences in economic self-interest, and the often-mentioned chasm between supporters of mainstream and extremist parties, provide little insight into the public divide over Grexit. Instead, we show that the key factor is the split between the left and the right. We then develop and test a set of theoretical explanations for the prominence of this cleavage. We find that the left-right divide over Grexit is not driven by differences in attitudes on redistribution, levels of empathy, or general European Union support. Instead, left and right voters seem to have different expectations about how a default and exit of a currency-union member would affect the European economy. These expectations likely reflect differences in core beliefs about the consequences of a free-market approach."
Economic Institutions and Autocratic Breakdown: Monetary Constraints and Fiscal Spending in Dominant-Party Regimes,"How do militaries respond to peace after civil war? The literature gives us a good understanding of how peace agreements affect the chances of civil war recurrence. However, it misses another aspect of postwar conflict: military coups. I argue that civil war peace agreements increase the risk of a coup, as the military anticipates threats to its interests. Military integration provisions pose a particularly strong challenge. These provisions may entail the dissolution and reconstitution of the military, and the military will have to agree to work alongside former enemies. Facing this, the military may attempt a coup. I test this theory using data on civil war peace agreements and coup attempts and present two main findings: in a global sample of states, those that have recently signed peace agreements are much more likely to see coups, and agreements with integration provisions are particularly likely to lead to coups."
From Representation to Collaboration (and Vice Versa): Antagonisms in Sonia Boyce’s Participatory Projects,"How do African governments respond to democratic electoral competition? Although the common perception is that African governments have sought to win elections by combining various types of electoral fraud, clientelism, and ethnic mobilization, I argue that democratic elections in Africa have also induced governments to compete for votes by providing basic services. One implication of this is a rural bias in the impact of democracy on basic health and education outcomes. Using individual-level data from 27 African countries, I investigate the theoretical claim that competitive elections create incentives for African governments to implement prorural policies in order to satisfy the rural majority. The results demonstrate that democratic elections significantly increase access to primary education and reduce infant mortality rates, but only for children in rural areas. As the argument expects, these effects are conditional on the level of urbanization."
Black Bodies on Lockdown: AIDS Moral Panic and the Criminalization of HIV in Times of White Injury,"This article argues that ownership reveals why slavery is a distinct form of oppression. To do so, it recovers the key features of Harriet Jacobs’s slave narrative: (1) slaves are denied recognition as persons; (2) they are subject to all the powers that inhere in ownership—a slaveowner can lawfully use, sell, or destroy his slave property; and (3) slavery, as a de jure institution, imposes obligations on third parties to maintain it. First, I show that Jacobs locates the distinctive, gendered wrongs of slavery in ownership rights. Second, I contend that the right to use transforms a master’s coercion into an owner’s authority. Third, I argue that the right to alienate is the source of a slave’s natal alienation and qualified disposability. Fourth, I maintain that the right to security obligates third parties to reinforce slavery. These features of ownership, taken together, explain why slavery is an unparalleled wrong."
Estimating Substantive Effects in Binary Outcome Panel Models: A Comparison,"Sartre’s visit to the Middle East turned into a fiasco, and the French philosopher ultimately signed a public letter in support of Israel. A few years later, the situation had changed completely: the French Left overwhelmingly took sides with the Palestinians, and Arab militants in France were key in triggering this turnaround. This was but one consequence of the multilayered interactions between Arab and European left-wing militant landscapes during the May ’68 momentum. The Arab New Left was a constitutive part of this global moment. Yet the Arab Left and “May ’68” have long been set apart from the growing literature on the revolutionary Left during the long sixties. Following three militant paths between France and the Arab East, I decipher the reconfigurations of geographies of resistance and the processes of resignification as symbols and know-how were displaced and transformed through ever more complex itineraries."
Gallery Scrapbook as Suffrage Archive: Macbeth’s Suffrage Exhibition,"Taking Norwegian musicology as a case study, this article explores scholarly forgetting at the intersection between academic music historiography and public music history. More specifically, it takes the national historiography about Edvard Grieg (1843–1907) as a starting point to explore how national stardom, based on ritualized commemoration, can paradoxically result in scholarly forgetting. In order to establish musicology as an academic discipline, the first generation of Norwegian music scholars had a delicate mission to fulfill. These scholars had to both consolidate Edvard Grieg’s significance as a national artist and legitimize his reputation as an internationally recognized genius. Still, from its beginnings in the 1950s up to the early 1990s, the scope of Norwegian musicology was very much nationally oriented. By making Grieg a star of national culture, there was much less room for more critical approaches to his legacy, going beyond the level of historical anecdote and popular myth. This article examines how this specific style of creating national stardom for Grieg in music historiography has contributed to forgetting processes both within and beyond Grieg studies, that is both in scholarship and in national memory culture. Additionally, it will demonstrate how a more critical historiography of Grieg studies might open up forgotten knowledge and thus interrupt the continuous process of recycling and repetition of memories and anecdotes that is central to the Norwegian “Grieg cult.” This is a balancing act, since musicology should, on the one hand, observe its contract with the audiences and readers without, on the other, continuously reifying Grieg’s stardom in a way that eclipses those aspects of the man and his work that are not in compliance with the national myth. In this way, I will argue, scholarship can be both a catalyst of and an antidote to forgetting."
Left-Right Ideology and the Debate over International Bailouts: The Case of Grexit,"The life of Black labor activist Floria Pinkney exemplifies the powerful connections between labor unions, workers’ education, and the YWCA that set the stage for the long Civil Rights Movement. In the 1920s Pinkney attended three workers’ education colleges: Brookwood Labor College, the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers, and the International People’s College in Denmark. Pinkney also became a prominent labor organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) and worked in the New Deal’s Workers’ Education Project. The 1930s alliance between labor and civil rights generally marks the starting decade of the long Civil Rights Movement. But this alliance was fostered by an earlier left culture of social unionism and workers’ education. Pinkney’s journey through this world illustrates Black women’s propagation of this culture. Her life exposes how the expansive networks of labor and civil rights organizations empowered working-class Black women in the interwar period."
Recovering Conceptions of Time from A Theory of Justice,"Individuals who take advantage of global networks to flee abroad with allegedly corrupt proceeds comprise an important yet understudied group of corruption suspects. We characterize them as “globalized corruption fugitives” and, using the case of China, investigate how they take advantage of international loopholes. Under President Xi Jinping, China actively began to pursue such suspects. Our analysis of their backgrounds and how they evade repatriation to China is based mainly on a list of China’s 100 wanted fugitives issued through Interpol Red Notices, supplemented with interviews and documentary data. We find that (1) unexpectedly, government officials did not comprise the majority in the sample; rather, state-owned companies and financial institutions, especially those based in coastal regions, seem to breed fugitive corruption suspects; (2) a tremendous amount of capital has been laundered; (3) Western countries are the most popular destinations of these fugitives, due in part to the protection against repatriation of these countries’ legal systems; and (4) Hong Kong serves as a distinct transit point for fugitives from the PRC’s justice system. This research highlights the transnational dimension of such corruption cases."
The Perils of Peace: Civil War Peace Agreements and Military Coups,"“Poems That Kill” examines the connection between poetry and revolution in Amiri Baraka’s “Black Art” (1965) and in general. The article tracks how Baraka uses poetry to start or advance a revolution in his own life, in the lives of his contemporaries, in poetry, in our present moment, and in the future. The article also discusses poetic address (how poems address readers), sincerity, ambiguity, and hate speech."
COVID-19 Metaphors,"Despite the abundance of evidence that peacekeeping works, we know little about what actually makes peacekeepers effective. Recent work suggesting that local agendas are central to modern conflicts make this omission particularly problematic. The article demonstrates that the presence of peacekeepers makes individuals more optimistic about the risks of engagement and the likelihood that members of out-groups will reciprocate cooperation. I use data from a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted in Mali, a West African country with an active conflict managed by troops from France and the United Nations (UN), to show that UN peacekeepers increase the willingness of individuals to cooperate relative to control and French enforcers. Moreover, I find that UN peacekeepers are especially effective among those participants who hold other groups and institutions in low esteem, as well as those who have more frequent contact with peacekeepers. Follow-up interviews and surveys suggest that perceptions of the UN as unbiased rather than other mechanisms account for its effectiveness."
"Who Is Democracy Good For? Elections, Rural Bias, and Health and Education Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa","We argue that leaders employ one of two strategies to govern subnational regions. These governance strategies, in turn, condition how leaders appoint and manage the regional executives to whom they delegate authority. In the co-optation strategy, leaders advance local welfare by appointing locally embedded regional executives, who are drawn from the local population and enjoy relatively long tenures. In the suppression strategy, leaders ensure that regional executives suppress local threats to the regime by minimizing local embeddedness, which entails appointing nonnative executives and shuffling them frequently. The regional governance strategy that a leader employs, we argue, depends on the region’s ex ante level of regime support. We test the theory with original data from the Republic of Congo and Kenya, encompassing 250 regional executives across three presidents. Although incumbent governments in Congo and Kenya confront different local threats, our findings highlight how similarly they manage the trade-offs of local embeddedness."
Peculiar Property: Harriet Jacobs on the Nature of Slavery,"“An Immodest Proposal” is a kind of apologia written in thanks. Susan Arndt, Katherine Harloe, Haun Saussy, and Suzanne Marchand articulate a variety of places where the proposals of “A Brief History” should be clarified or corrected. This response accepts Arndt’s, Harloe’s, Saussy’s, and Marchand’s invitations for clarification and correction. The article concludes with a reiteration of the potential of “contemporary humanities studies” as a response to the crisis in the humanities. This response represents the eponymous immodest proposal: that humanists create a pedagogical space interested in explorations of ending the history of the inhumanities and beginning a humanities capable of garnering universal support."
About the Term Exile,"Do elected representatives reflect the preferences of the citizens they represent? Recent studies from the United States and a number of other democracies have found that legislators tend to represent better the preferences of affluent citizens. However, we still know little about how widespread this bias is. To answer this question, we gathered every publicly available survey of elected representatives in the world and matched it with mass survey data. Our data set consists of 92,000 elite observations and 3.9 million citizen observations spread across 565 country-years, 52 individual countries, and 33 years. Using a variety of methods, we find that around the world, legislators’ preferences are consistently more congruent with those of affluent citizens. However, we also find that this inequality varies substantially by issue domain: while the affluent are better represented on economic issues, the poor seem to be overrepresented on cultural issues."
The Arab New Left and May ’68: Transnational Entanglements at a Time of Disruption,"This article restores to us one of the manuscript collections of inscriptions compiled at the turn of the sixteenth century by Matteo Geronimo Mazza, a jurist, politician and scholar from Salerno. A prominent figure in Renaissance antiquarianism, Mazza compiled several epigraphic sylloges, which, together with his own collection of inscribed marbles, remained after his death in the villa he had built in Marechiaro at the edge of the bay of Naples, among the ruins of a Roman Temple of Fortune and the ancient villa of Vedius Pollio. Most of Mazza’s manuscripts have long been considered lost. In the mid-nineteenth century, when Theodor Mommsen was compiling volume X of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, he searched unsuccessfully for Mazza’s sylloges, eventually making do instead with a set of eighteenth-century copies, which he found in the archives of Ludovico Muratori in Modena. One of Mazza’s manuscripts, however, had come into the hands of Sir William Hamilton, who, in 1801, donated it to the Society of Antiquaries in London. The recovery of this single epigraphic sylloge provides us with new information not only on Mazza himself but relating to inscriptions, monumental sites and sixteenth-century collections in southern Italy. The article also retraces the external history of the manuscript and the routes by which it left Naples for London, thereby revealing the dense network of eighteenth-century antiquarians who actively studied and copied materials preserved in Mazza’s villa, and shedding new light on some of his other sylloges, which are still lost. All these findings are additionally presented in tabular form at the end of the article in a series of Appendices, supplemented by Indices which group and distill the inscriptions themselves."
The Eclipse Effects of Stardom: Edvard Grieg as a Challenge to National Musicology,"In this essay, I analyze the production of value in the shamanic complex of the indigenous Cofán people of eastern Ecuador. While acknowledging the ethical nature of human existence and the generative power of human action, I describe the shaman as a paradoxical figure with regard to the efforts that produce him and the criteria that orient his actions. The shaman occupies a central social position, but he profits from little Cofán labor and receives mixed Cofán praise. Consequently, it is arguable that he represents no value at all. If anything, I suggest, he embodies valueless value, a concept I articulate in relation to Pierre Clastres’s notion of “powerless power.” In dialogue with the anthropology of ethics, morality, and productive action, I use my analysis of Cofán shamanism to demonstrate the utility of a value-based approach in any ethnographic investigation that takes human practice as its primary object."
Democracy in Disarray,"This article reads Max Weber’s Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion (1920/1921), in particular the first two sections, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Confucianism and Taoism, as his comparative philosophy of life. While Weber’s thesis about the determining effect of Protestantism on the emergence of industrial capitalism has been taken as a justification for the superiority of Western culture and its uniqueness in the world, this article emphasizes Weber’s critique of Protestant asceticism and his pessimism toward the West in the early twentieth century. Weber’s critique is deeply connected to his concerns about life and freedom and his imagination of an aesthetic way of life in Chinese Confucianism, in which he believes to have found a well-balanced rational culture that accepts and appreciates irrationalism, as expressed in Taoism. And, as the article observes, Weber’s philosophy of life centering on aesthetic self-cultivation inspired Michel Foucault’s concept of the care of the self in the 1980s. Weber’s sociology of religion thus articulates his vision of freedom in the age of global capitalism—it is his Confucian care of the self."
"Corey Byrnes, Fixing Landscape: A Techno-Poetic History of China’s Three Gorges","This essay addresses what I take to be a paradox in Africa’s constitution as a scholarly object of inquiry. The study of Africa renders Africa both visible and invisible. When the humanities—and the social sciences—appear beleaguered, solving this paradox may hold the key to understanding what we need to say we are studying for us to say what we are good for. What is left over when we remove Africa from the stock of knowledge the humanities produce?"
"Michael Rothberg, The Implicated Subject: Beyond Victims and Perpetrators","Why are high-income and low-income earners not significantly polarized in their support for progressive income taxation? This article posits that the affluent fail to recognize that they belong to the high-income income group and this misperception affects their preferences over progressive taxation. To explain this mechanism theoretically, I introduce a formal model of subjective income-group identification through self-comparison to an endogenous reference group. In making decisions about optimal tax rates, individuals then use these subjective evaluations of their own income group and earnings of other groups. Relying on ISSP data, I find strong evidence for the model’s empirical implications: most high-income earners support progressive taxation when they identify themselves with a lower group. Additionally, individuals who overestimate the earnings of the rich are more likely to support progressive taxation."
Networks of Resistance: Floria Pinkney and Labor Interracialism in Interwar America,"Ania Loomba has suggested that we attend to two techniques of racialized governance in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England: “the creation of internal hierarchies within a population” and the increasingly reified assumption of “correspondence between the ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ of human beings.” This essay claims that The Faerie Queene produces a surprising resemblance between racialization and allegory as a literary form. Testing this hypothesis primarily in Book V’s scenes of racialized punishment, it explores how allegory produces internal hierarchies and a correspondence between the outside and inside of beings in the poem. At the same time, it suggests Spenser’s immanent critique of allegory as technique and mode might also be viewed as the poem’s own analysis of the intimacy between racialization and colonial violence, repeatedly revealing the failure of the production of difference and the instability of racialized hierarchy."
Out of China’s Reach: Globalized Corruption Fugitives,"Does routinized police repression spark or quell everyday cooperation within frequently repressed communities? This important question has been neglected by comparative studies of policing, which have largely examined how repression affects citizen willingness to protest against the state. I study the effects of policing on cooperation within an important, frequently repressed urban community: poor internal migrants. Empirically, I draw on ethnography and a large-scale survey experiment (N=2,400) with migrants in urban India. I find repression prompts migrants to express increased willingness to cooperate with another migrant at shared work sites but not within shared residences. These effects can even extend across economic and ethnic rivalries. I find suggestive evidence that repression induces solidarities rooted in shared experiences with the authorities, not simply pity for police targets. More broadly, this study suggests the growing interest in studying everyday urban policing in wealthy Western democracies should be extended to the global south."
The Pop Industry from Stagnation to Perestroika: How Music Professionals Embraced the Economic Reform That Broke East European Cultural Networks,"This account dates from 1985, originally a companion piece to “Discovering ‘social control’” (1985), but not published in this form then. The ethnographic milieu is Hagen, in Papua New Guinea, under the colonial regime of the 1960s and 70s, and the Australian version of an “imposition of law.” In an attempt to get out from under then current presuppositions over the nature of law in relation to constructs of society, it embarks on describing the two modes of Hagen sociality that were to figure in The gender of the gift (1988). Two circuits in the circulation and reception of emotions channel the way in which people deal with conflict; while they are irreducibly distinct, they are asymmetrical in their influence on general social life, such that affairs conducted through one circuit may damage those of the other. One consequence is quite a blunt description of certain aspects of power relations."
Poems That Kill,"How courts ensure the efficacy of their decisions poses one of the central challenges to the quality of modern liberal democracy. In this article, we consider how the ability of domestic courts to engage with their international counterparts through preliminary reference procedures can further this goal. Arguing that domestic courts use preliminary reference procedures to affect the probability that their governments comply with adverse judicial decisions, we construct a formal model of the reference procedure and test a series of empirical implications with a novel data set of domestic court cases involving the European Union’s preliminary reference procedure. We find that courts are more likely to refer cases as the risk of noncompliance increases and that this relationship is conditional on the level of public trust in the Court of Justice of the European Union and the position of a court in the domestic judicial hierarchy."
Queer Love,"Permissibility of electoral systems, and in particular the conversion of voices in the electorate to the legislature, is broadly considered to depend on the number of seats per district (district magnitude) in a country. Yet the most prevalent electoral system in the democratic world, proportional representation with districts, is often characterized by an almost entirely overlooked variation: within the same country districts vary in their magnitude, sometimes by a factor of 20. How does such variation affect permissibility of electoral systems? Drawing on a broad cross-section of democracies, we demonstrate that contrary to what the literature implicitly assumes, other things equal, a combination of large and small districts results in greater permissibility than a set of districts of similar magnitude. We find that where districts are of similar (different) magnitude the degree of permissibility is lower (higher) than that found by current literature."
Peacekeeping and the Enforcement of Intergroup Cooperation: Evidence from Mali,"Most historians associate Germany’s transition in 1930 to government by presidential emergency decrees based on Article 48 of the Weimar constitution with authoritarian conservatism, and there certainly were powerful conservative forces that advocated government by decree to cripple the power of the democratically elected Reichstag. Most leaders of Germany’s two liberal parties also concluded by 1929, however, that parliamentary government suffered from paralysis, because each party had become dedicated to serving particular interest groups rather than the common good. They had anchored strong powers for the president in the constitution in 1919, urged Friedrich Ebert to make full use of those powers in 1923, and sought good relations with President Hindenburg after his election in 1925 and enhancement of his popularity. They hoped in 1929/30 that Hindenburg could make full use of his constitutional prerogatives and his great popularity as a war hero to influence the quarrelsome Reichstag delegations to seek reasonable compromises, and if necessary to appeal to the electorate in alliance with the chancellor he trusted to support moderate policies. These liberals influenced Hindenburg in 1929/30 both directly and indirectly through two of his closest advisers, Defense Minister Wilhelm Groener and State Secretary Otto Meissner. The utter collapse of the liberal parties at the polls from 1930 to 1932 deprived these liberals of influence, however, and left the authoritarian conservative concept of presidential government largely unchallenged within Hindenburg’s inner circle. It would be a great mistake nevertheless to believe that everyone who supported the idea of a “Hindenburg cabinet” in 1929/30 advocated something resembling the harshly antidemocratic practice of the Papen cabinet in 1932."
Regional Governance in Divided Societies: Evidence from the Republic of Congo and Kenya,"Focusing on the work of the historians of early modern science and philosophy Eugenio Garin and Paolo Rossi, the anthropologist Ernesto De Martino, and the historian Carlo Ginzburg, this essay aims to frame the relationship between science and magic in postwar Italian historiography within the context of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Garin and Rossi investigated the seventeenth-century science’s roots in Renaissance authors. In the same years, De Martino carried out fieldwork on the magical worldview of farmers of southern Italy, aiming to explain how such doctrines had been connected and somehow shaped by the culture of the elites since the Renaissance. Some years later, Ginzburg, explicitly inspired by De Martino’s work, investigated the popular magic of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Friulan peasants and its relationship with the culture of the elites. This essay aims to show how the ideas of these historians was influenced by Antonio Gramsci’s ideas and how they were connected with the cultural policies of the Italian Communist Party, which indirectly affected the view of historians on science, magic, popular culture and the culture of the elites, and modernity in postwar Italy. This essay also highlights the differences between contemporary Italian, British, and US historians in light of their different cultural agendas."
"Friends of the Emir: Non-Muslim State Officials in Premodern Islamic Thought, by Luke B. Yarbrough","Scholars and other congressional observers argue that the erosion of so-called regular order legislative processes exacerbates partisan conflict in Congress. In this article, we investigate whether laws passed via more unorthodox and leadership-led legislative processes garner less bipartisan support than those passed under regular order processes. Drawing on an original data set of important laws passed by Congress from 1987 to 2016 (the 100th–114th Congresses), we find little connection between violations of regular order and the amount of partisanship observed on either initial or final passage votes. In-depth interviews with long-time members of Congress and high-level congressional staffers reveal that centralized and unorthodox processes are frequently used not to pass partisan bills but because these methods are efficient in resolving legislative impasses. The flexibility and secrecy permitted by unorthodox processes can assist in negotiating agreements to enact even highly bipartisan legislation."
An Immodest Proposal—in Thanks for Responses to the Inhumanities,"This article traces the transnational imperial history of industrial education as a way to analyze the complex relationship between American slavery, emancipation, and empire. It does so by introducing the Black Pacific as an analytic frame capable of expanding the boundaries of Black internationalism. Through archiving the lived experiences of Helen James as an everyday Black teacher who navigated American empire at the Kona Orphanage on Hawai‘i, this article shows how the afterlives of slavery structurally informed American overseas empire (and vice versa) through a powerful transnational industrial education network. In the end, it argues that scholars of Black internationalism should be more attentive to the limits of anticolonial solidarity as an organizing principle and think in a more sustained way not only about how activists resist and dismantle empires but how those empires were built in the first place—often in spite of (and in response to) Black liberation efforts themselves."
Affluence and Congruence: Unequal Representation around the World,"This essay introduces the field of Mexican drug history and the five essays that follow in this special issue. Through a brief review of some major points of interest and contention over more than five hundred years of history, it argues that the related scholarship is coming into its own and should be of considerable interest to drug historians worldwide."
Matteo Geronimo Mazza: A Recovered Sylloge by a Renaissance Antiquarian and Collector,"This article traces the long-run contribution of the employment of enslaved Africans in large-scale commodity production in the Americas to the rise of the capitalist global economy. It demonstrates the two-stage evolution of the global economy—the rise of the nineteenth-century capitalist Atlantic economic system (the nucleus of the global economy), the first stage, and the extension of that system to Asia and the rest of the world, the second stage. It shows that the establishment of the integrated nineteenth-century Atlantic economy was a function of the growth of multilateral trade in the Atlantic basin that resulted from the employment of enslaved Africans in large-scale commodity production in the Americas, on which basis the major economies of the Americas, especially the US economy, and Western European economies, especially the British economy, achieved structural transformation, which included the British Industrial Revolution and its new technologies. Led by Great Britain, the advanced economies of the Atlantic world employed the new technologies of the Industrial Revolution, economically and politically, to extend the Atlantic capitalist economic order to Asia and the rest of the world to constitute the hierarchically structured capitalist global economic order."
Valueless value: The question of production in Cofán shamanism,"How do legislative term limits affect representation? Proponents’ arguments that term limits would reduce partisan conflict and improve the quality of representation have received surprisingly little empirical scrutiny. We argue that term limits increase party polarization by changing legislators’ electoral and career incentives, in turn increasing the role of parties in legislative processes. Using panel data on roll call voting patterns from 1993 to 2016, we show that term limits produced systematically higher levels of polarization in state legislative voting patterns by increasing the ideological gap between Republicans’ and Democrats’ voting records. Consistent with our theoretical account, we further show that term limits had larger effects in more professional legislatures and increased contributions from party committees to legislative candidates. Contrary to the goals of their proponents, terms limits exacerbated the legislative consequences of contemporary partisanship and have implications for understanding how electoral and career incentives affect legislative outcomes."
Max Weber’s Confucian Care of the Self,This case study will take Volker Losemann’s recently published collection of essays titled Clio und die Nationalsozialisten and the (often far from complimentary) reception of his groundbreaking work on classics in the Third Reich since the 1970s as a starting point to reflect on wider discourses that have led to academic “forgetting” of this period in German classical scholarship.
Surplus Data: An Introduction,"Why do some ethnic groups vote along ethnic lines while others do not? In this article, we theorize that the level of ethnic voting depends, partially, on how ethnicity interacts with economic cleavages. Specifically, we argue that between–ethnic group inequality (BGI) increases ethnic voting and that its effect strengthens as within–ethnic group inequality (WGI) decreases. We thus posit that the full structure of ethnic inequality, not only between-group differences, matters for ethnic voting. After presenting our argument, we conduct the first cross-national test of whether the effect of between-group inequality on ethnic voting is conditional on the level of inequality within ethnic groups. Our analysis employs group-level data on 200 ethnic groups from 65 countries. We find strong support for our hypothesis: BGI increases ethnic voting, but its effect is conditional on WGI."
Unmaking Africa—the Humanities and the Study of What?,"Appointing or electing professionals to be public officials is a double-edged sword. Experts can use their rich knowledge to implement reforms, but they can also favor their own profession. In this study, we compare physician-trained state health ministers to ministers of other professions in Germany during 1955–2017. German state health ministers have great power to determine hospital capacities and infrastructure. Our results show that physician-trained health ministers increase hospital capacities, capital, and funding by the statutory health insurance (SHI). This prompts hospitals to hire more physicians, but with little impact on hospital outputs. As a result, total factor productivity (TFP) growth in hospital care slows down substantially under physician-ministers. At the same time, job satisfaction of hospital doctors tends to increase. We conclude that, in particular, the medical profession benefits from medical doctors in office."
"Who Is High Income, Anyway? Social Comparison, Subjective Group Identification, and Preferences over Progressive Taxation","Contemporary concerns with the prospects for capitalism and its potentially deleterious effects are an episode in an ongoing debate over commercial society going back nearly three centuries. Adam Smith and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were leading figures on opposed sides in the eighteenth-century debate, and yet scholars have recently highlighted the remarkably similar way Smith and Rousseau both diagnose the potential psychological, moral, and economic ills of commercial society. Why, then, does Smith advocate commercial society, while Rousseau opposes it? We argue that Smith’s divergence from Rousseau is decisively based on his distinct account of human psychology. Specifically, we demonstrate that Smith’s theory of mutual sympathy differs from Rousseau’s understanding of pity (pitié) such that Smith is led to be cautiously optimistic about the potential for positive-sum moral, social, and economic interactions among individuals, or what we term the “moral economy.”"
Crisis Management: Women’s Letters of Assistance and Commiseration in Sixteenth-Century Northern Italy,"Two conflicting interest groups buy favor from a policy maker. Influence is modeled as a common-agency game with lobbyists proposing monetary contributions contingent on decisions. When the preferences of the group members are common knowledge, groups form efficiently and lobbying competition perfectly aggregates preferences. When those preferences are instead private information, free riding in collective action arises within groups. Free riding implies that the influence of a group is weakened and that lobbying competition imperfectly aggregates preferences. By softening lobbying competition, private information might also increase groups’ payoffs and hurt the policy maker. Importantly, the magnitudes of informational frictions within each group are jointly determined at equilibrium. We draw from these findings a number of implications for the organization of interest groups."
Allegorization and Racialization in The Faerie Queene,"The FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP), a seagoing vessel managed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, offers an unusual vantage point on the sea, one useful for reflecting on how the figure of the “field” is made in oceanography—and how it rotates in and out of alignment with attempts to render portions of the sea more lab-like. FLIP works like this: in its horizontal conformation, the vessel travels like an ordinary oceangoing craft. But by “flipping” 90 degrees into a vertical position once it arrives at its destination—with all the instrumentation inside swiveling correspondingly—it becomes an enormous spar buoy, more or less stationary in the wave field. This essay draws on the author’s anthropology-of-science fieldwork on FLIP to offer prompts for thinking about objectivity, orientation, and perspective in the practice of at-sea fieldwork."
On Power and the Law: McGirt v. Oklahoma,"The only lasting policy change implemented by the education minister of the newly established Chinese Republic in 1912 was an official commitment to “aesthetic education” (meiyu): Cai Yuanpei (1868–1940) appropriated Kantian and Schillerian aesthetics to serve Republican China’s needs. This article offers a new reading of Cai’s 1917 proposal to “replace religion with aesthetic education.” By reading Cai’s proposal in light of his long-standing interest in religion, as well as the debate about religion taking place in the pages of the avant-garde journal New Youth at the time, I demonstrate that he avoided the rhetoric of “national salvation” projects and instead outlined a more individually focused vision for the place of aesthetic education. I trace Cai’s conception of aesthetic education to its roots in his policy proposals as education minister (1912), which elucidate a vision of education based on a Schillerian conception of aesthetic experience as occupying a parapolitical space."
Does Police Repression Spur Everyday Cooperation? Evidence from Urban India,"Considerations of the natural environment permeate drug policy formulation, drug crop production, and trafficking. Cultivators, traffickers, and drug control authorities seek to mold nature to further their respective ends, even as they are also limited by the natural world. Given the environmental realities of cultivating, trafficking, and controlling illegal drugs, more attention to this fact is needed in drug history scholarship. Examining United Nations– and United States–led efforts at poppy replacement in Afghanistan in 1958, 1972, and 1977—and framing opium production and drug control as part of natural resource development in Afghanistan—this article unites strands of scholarship from environmental, foreign relations, and drug history. These episodes of development-as-drug-control demonstrate that throughout the history of economic development in the name of poppy reduction in Afghanistan, Western officials could not redirect the economic and environmental conditions structuring poppy farmers’ lives. While much attention has been paid to Afghan opium after the 1979 Soviet invasion, this lesser-known story of drug control proves instructive for understanding present failures."
The mediation of emotions: On aspects of dispute settlement and violence in Hagen,"The 2008 Sichuan earthquake was one of the deadliest natural disasters in China’s recent history, and it inspired unprecedented activism in China. This article shows that one important yet overlooked path to the development of new NGOs in Sichuan was a massive transfer of resources and personnel from other provincial governments. Pairing richer provinces with poorer ones to spur development was already a PRC practice and was immediately implemented when the earthquake struck; transferred officials with experience working with NGOs in their own provinces brought such NGOs with them, helped to create new organizations in Sichuan, and facilitated cooperation between local officials and NGO activists—a scenario neglected in earlier studies. The disaster provided an opportunity for local governments in Sichuan to learn how to outsource social service programs to cooperative NGOs, in line with recent policy elsewhere in China."
"Julia F. Saville, Victorian Soul-Talk: Poetry, Democracy, and the Body Politic","What matters is not what we know but how we learn. This principle of inquiry shapes Paul Rabinow’s life work. It is also an ethics, an aspiration. This principle sustains the practice of problematization, or the delineation of zones of inquiry in terms of the conceptual interconnection of problems. In contrast to anthropological practice that is defined by the perpetual critique of existing relations, Rabinow assumes a mode of adjacency so as to consider the ways that we give form to objects of inquiry and to intelligible concepts. Adjacency is a commitment to actualize a differential—not to reproduce perpetual critique, but to practice inquiry as a mode of form-giving. And it entails secession, or a movement towards experimentation in diverse media. The secessionist move doesn’t revert to the authority of theory or ontology. It is a commitment to new forms, new futures, confidence in the future."
Can International Courts Enhance Domestic Judicial Review? Separation of Powers and the European Court of Justice,"The year 2019 marked the four hundredth anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans on the shores of Jamestown, Virginia, in British North America. The origin story of the ensuing Black freedom struggle in what would become the United States of America then can be traced back to 1619, a defining moment in American and global history. Jamestown offers the racial origin story of what would become the United States of America. For Black America, the subsequent four centuries have produced a long struggle for citizenship, equality, and freedom that continues into the present but remains rooted in the nation’s original sin of racial slavery. Today, slavery’s aftermath hovers over contemporary American race relations in deep and profoundly disturbing ways, including how textbooks attempt to ignore the unsavory parts of this history, going so far as to characterize enslaved Africans brought to American shores as “workers” in a misguided effort to sanitize this painful chapter in our national story."
Permissibility of Electoral Systems: A New Look at an Old Question,"Cross-pressured partisans are commonly viewed as persuadable, and campaigns routinely target these voters in elections. Yet evidence of the causal impact of policy cross-pressures on voting behavior is limited. We deployed randomized experiments to examine whether (and how) nonpartisan information that highlighted policy cross-pressures affected voting in the 2015 Kentucky gubernatorial election. Our results suggest partisans conflicted with their party’s gubernatorial nominee on the issue of Kynect, Kentucky’s health-care exchange, who were exposed to information about the candidates’ positions were more likely to report defection intentions in a preelection survey, but these did not necessarily materialize on Election Day. Information exposure seems to have produced few discernible effects on voting overall, based on self-reports in postelection surveys we conducted, but an examination of validated voting records suggests cross-pressured partisans were generally more likely to abstain when provided with the policy positions of both gubernatorial candidates."
German Liberalism and the Origins of Presidential Government in the Weimar Republic,"Do investment disputes reduce foreign direct investment (FDI)? Investors may perceive host governments involved in arbitration as riskier. Yet a dispute may also signal new economic opportunities for firms hoping to enter the same industry as the disputant firm. These competing pressures mean the impact of disputes on FDI is ex ante unclear. However, the balance of risk and opportunity varies across industry fixed asset intensity (FAI). FAI is associated with both the irreversibility of investment, which influences risk, as well as the structure of the market, which shapes competitive opportunities arising from a dispute. We expect the rewards from investment to exceed risk as industry FAI increases. Using new data on industry-level greenfield FDI between countries from 2003 to 2015, we find that a coindustrial dispute reduces investment in industries with low FAI but increases FDI in those with high FAI. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous investors."
"Science, Natural Magic, and the Subaltern Worldview in Postwar Italian Historiography","In this conclusion, the editors of this symposium provide a concise synthesis and summary of the other contributions. We highlight questions and underscore potential criticisms with an aim to kickstarting some debate. We call for the adoption of a practicably holistic approach to securitization studies and recommend some key elements of this holism, including a focus on failed securitizations, objects, and ethics, to be considered by securitization scholars."
What Is Regular Order Worth? Partisan Lawmaking and Congressional Processes,"Some language encourages essentialist thinking. While philosophers have largely focused on generics and essentialism, I argue that nouns as a category are poised to refer to kinds and to promote representational essentializing. Our psychological propensity to essentialize when nouns are used reveals a limitation for antiessentialist ameliorative projects. Even ameliorated nouns can continue to underpin essentialist thinking. I conclude by arguing that representational essentialism does not doom antiessentialist ameliorative projects. Rather, it reveals that would-be ameliorators ought to attend to the propensities for our representational devices to essentialize and to the complex relationship between essentialism and prejudice."
"Virginia in the Pacific: Slavery, Empire, and the Colonial Design of American Education","While recent amendments to India’s Citizenship Act are designed to exclude Muslims from claims to citizenship in India, this essay seeks to problematize the assumption that Hindu migrants who seek citizenship under the new Act are incorporated seamlessly and unproblematically into the nation. The constitutional grant of citizenship and social acceptance into everyday local worlds are not always congruent. My ethnographic examples are drawn from an earlier wave of migration of Hindu men from Sindh into western India. They illustrate both a feeling of love and anticipation at the prospect of Indian citizenship as well as an acute sense of betrayal that they did not get “anything else” apart from legal citizenship—which in this case is social dignity, honor, and acceptance into local Hindu caste society. While the state may read cross-border migration in the terms of broad religious categorizations that are then written into its citizenship laws, there is no good reason to assume that these legal documents translate into everyday life in the same manner. The grant of citizenship—even to the Hindus that the state is so eager to make into citizens—is not the end of the story of cross-border migration; often it is just the beginning of a long negotiation for migrants who need to learn a new language of belonging in order to integrate. That language—as this ethnographic example from Kutch shows us— has to do as much with caste equations as with the question of religion or nationality per se."
A Tapestry of Laws: Legal Pluralism in Eighteenth-Century Britain,"The concept of traditional medicine, for all its multifaceted roots, achieved global prominence only during the Cold War era in the wake of massive decolonization. While developments within Asia contributed to this shift, it was often leaders and diplomats from newly independent African countries who first put different aspects of traditional medicine forward for debate within United Nations agencies. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), along with several other pan-African initiatives, paved the way for this work, tying the continent’s cultural heritage to its medical heritage and pushing for its “cultural property” to be protected as intellectual property. These goals were both precedent setting and inherently fraught: they gave states more tacit power to act as gatekeepers for those labeled “traditional healers” (who often referred to themselves by different terms entirely and had ambivalent relationships to state authorities). Diplomats also promoted an ethos that endogenous experts’ “know-how” was a public good and the preserve of governments, rather than private capital. This article reconstructs a central strand in the story of how traditional medicine went global, paying special attention to pan-African networks’ radical foreign policy agendas. These ultimately ensured that global institutions, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), opened their doors to polyglot therapeutics (or different conceptual schemas to define health and illness) and promoted the idea that heterodox healers were integral to people’s rights to health. Though pan-African initiatives were unable to overturn deeply entrenched power imbalances or enact their full agenda, they did have lasting legal, policy, and epistemic effects that continue to reverberate around the world to this day."
"Genealogy, Critical Theory, History","This article offers a systematic and comprehensive account of the activities and policies of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Mexico between 1973, the year in which the agency was founded, and 1980, the year when most of the documents related to the DEA’s presence in Mexico were declassified. The essay draws on primary sources found in various archives in Mexico and the United States, including many recently declassified cables, letters, intelligence reports, and internal memorandums produced by DEA officials."
"Mexico, Shanghai, and Drug History’s Global Turn","How do right to work laws affect the distribution of economic resources? While sociological theories would predict inequality to increase following their passage, previous research finds these laws to be largely inconsequential. The author compiles a unique data set of 77 years of income and wage inequality data from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. census, the U.S. Union Sourcebook, and the National Labor Relations Board. After replicating inconsistent results from previous studies, the author shows that they mask substantial and robust heterogeneity across local areas. Right to work laws are consequential when passed in times and places where labor has something to lose. They remove the negative association between labor union membership and inequality, with the greatest consequences of right to work passage in highly unionized areas. In total, results suggest that right to work laws work as intended, increasing economic inequality indirectly by lowering labor power resources. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed."
Atlantic Slavery and the Rise of the Capitalist Global Economy,"Kantian statists believe that the state is a conceptual prerequisite for the acquisition of property rights and, hence, of freedom itself. They argue that under statelessness, property rights are indeterminate, unilateral, and unassured and therefore remain merely provisional until a state is instituted. We are not morally bound by merely provisional rights, and hence there can be no justice (or injustice) without a state. This article makes two arguments. First, it argues that property rights need not be conceptually indeterminate under statelessness. Social conventions that fall short of a state can give determinacy in ways that Kantians have not adequately considered. Second, it argues that the problems of unilateralism and nonassurance are parasitical on the problem of indeterminacy. Therefore, overcoming indeterminacy overcomes the overall thesis. I argue, therefore, that the state is not conceptually necessary to our freedom, and we have no unconditional natural duty to institute and obey a state."
Legislative Term Limits and Polarization,"We examine the distribution of economic productivity across subnational regions as a factor explaining the level and allocation of central government expenditure. As regional productivity becomes more dispersed, the preferences influencing national decision making should diverge, thus impeding agreement to expand the central state. However, if regional productivity becomes more right-skewed, an increasing number of less productive regions may be able to press for greater central outlays. Dispersion and skew of interregional inequality also shape the allocation of centralized spending. With growing economic dispersion across regions, decision makers are more likely to fund policy categories that aid citizens in all regions over those that are locally targeted. By contrast, with the distribution of regional productivity skewing farther to the right, central expenditure is likely to become more locally targeted. We find strong evidence for these propositions in error correction models using new measures of interregional inequality and government policy priorities for 24 OECD countries."
"Eine Vergangenheit, die lieber vergessen wird? Scholarly Habitus-Forming, Professional Amnesia, and Postwar Engagement with Nazi Classical Scholarship","Among the most distinctive maps of the seventeenth-century Caribbean is an unsigned 1670s manuscript map of English Montserrat. Unusual for its presentation of a series of seven perspectival views of the coastline, “Mountserrat Island 1673” captures a highly localized understanding of the island as a sequence of fragmented roadsteads with an unmapped and uncontrolled interior. Contrasting the Montserrat map with more conventional views of other British Caribbean islands reveals the divergent ways that colonists and metropolitan residents understood these colonies and the consequences for the construction of the British empire."
The Structure of Ethnic Inequality and Ethnic Voting,"This article aims to decentralize the dominant temporalities of the colonial era with reference to an ephemeral fragment of precolonial music from Uganda. The article outlines two overarching temporal frameworks—unilinear developmentalism and cultural relativism—as the fundamental global antinomies of colonial governance. By examining inherent pattern formation and beat entrainment in amadinda music, the article directs its findings to the general question of meter and rhythm in music and, by extension, the dialectics of colonial time itself. Instead of relativizing or provincializing this concept of time—a refinement of its historical critique—the article gestures toward recentralizing universal standards along more equitable and inclusive lines."
Are Doctors Better Health Ministers?,"This special volume, together with a forthcoming roundtable in Diplomatic History, provides a sampling of scholarship at the intersection of the “new” histories of drugs and US foreign relations while highlighting points of convergence between the two areas of study and the insights each field has to offer the other."
Mutual Sympathy and the Moral Economy: Adam Smith Reviews Rousseau,"Recent research has challenged the policy bases of the New Deal realignment, arguing that it was instead driven by retrospective evaluations of the economy. Using a comprehensive analysis of opinion polls conducted in 1936–52, we argue that policy preferences were far from irrelevant. At the individual level, presidential Republicans who became Democrats were much more supportive of New Deal policies than those who remained loyal (vice versa for Democrats). At the state level, both public support for the New Deal—as measured by a group-level item response model—and income growth predict pro-Democratic shifts in presidential elections. In short, the realignment was rooted in both policy preferences and economic retrospection. Moreover, mass support for the New Deal, unlike partisan identification, was a leading indicator of long-term electoral trends, predicting presidential elections decades in the future even better than it does contemporaneous elections."
The Roberts Court and Administrative Law,"The diverging existential and intellectual trajectories of three friends are examined in the perspective of writing as a martial art: the effort to dismantle the communist regime through the sheer power of thinking, with all the grave risks this effort involved."
“When Olson Meets Dahl”: From Inefficient Groups Formation to Inefficient Policy Making,"The article examines the articulation between Evangelicals and conservatism in the Brazilian scenario since widespread street demonstrations erupted in June 2013; the most significant of these events was the election of Far-Right president Jair Messias Bolsonaro in 2018. A sizable share of this religious segment constitutes, in different ways and in varying degrees, the broader social process that in the national and international public conversation became known as the conservative wave. My argument is that this wave is shaped as the articulation of distinct lines of force at play in the fields of economy, security, morality, and society."
Flipping the Field,"In this essay, I employ a philological approach to reading and analyzing Spanish-language historical documents that include Quechua, Aymara, and other non-Spanish terms to shed light on the records left by Native individuals, particularly women, in colonial Peru. Careful and rigorous attention to voice and language expands our understanding of the speaker’s intended meanings. Through this approach, I write an alternative history based on strategic speculation, but woven out of textual snapshots contextualized within their broader history and pieced together with an eye for narrative and plot as well as cultural and linguistic nuances. I illustrate this critical position and a methodology with the recasting of Kusi Warkay, an Indigenous woman often perceived as a poverty-stricken widow, but who was in fact one of the last local power players with enough influence among Inkas and Spaniards to also be considered as an important actor on a global scale."
Aesthetic Education for a Republican China,"Drawing on insights from recent economic theories of incomplete contracts, we develop a theoretical model on authority relationships in the Chinese bureaucracy by conceptualizing the allocation of control rights in goal setting, inspections, and provision of incentives among the principal, supervisor, and agents. Variations in the allocation of these control rights give rise to different modes of governance and entail distinct behavioral implications among the parties. The proposed model provides a unified framework and a set of analytical concepts to examine different governance structures, varying authority relationships, and the specific principal-agent problems entailed in a bureaucratic setting. We will illustrate this through a case study of authority relationships and ensuing behavioral patterns in the environmental protection arena over a five-year cycle of policy implementation."
"“Down Where the South Begins”: Black Richmond Activism before the Modern Civil Rights Movement, 1899–1930","This article considers the convergence of militarism and marketing in Colombia                     and argues that the axis of that confluence is the drive to appropriate                     intimacy, a fleeting index of love. I scrutinize this phenomenon in the context                     of the Colombian military’s individual demobilization program, which,                     prior to the peace accord of 2016, worked with the advertising firm that managed                     consumer brands such as Mazda and Red Bull. The double meaning of                     “campaigns” and “targets,” in the parlance of both                     generals and executives, was not haphazard but, rather, was doubly focusing on                     an effort to lure FARC guerrillas out of the insurgency and transform them into                     consumer citizens. I analyze how both consumer marketers and military                     intelligence officers went about their targeted persuasion, each creeping into                     increasingly personal realms. Situating my research in the broader context of                     the Global War on Terror and the rise of the global middle classes, I suggest                     that the fusion of militarism and marketing in Colombia is a harbinger of an                     affective mode of governance in the early twenty-first century that blurs                     military and civilian spheres as well as the temporal distinction between times                     of peace from times of war."
Race beyond Our Borders: Is Racial and Ethnic Immigration Selection Always Morally Wrong?,"Despite the seemingly widespread agreement that racial and ethnic immigration criteria are always wrong, some cases seem potentially permissible and, in particular, do not seem to wrong either disfavored members or nonmembers. I demonstrate that an “antidiscrimination” approach to understanding when and why discrimination is wrong provides a compelling general explanation for this. The explanation’s key ingredient is the concept of global social status: many groups sharing a race or ethnicity have a social status beyond, and that can differ from, their status in a particular state."
Ex Post Review and Expert Policy Making: When Does Oversight Reduce Accountability?,"Ex post review is a common feature of policy-making institutions. We consider an environment in which an expert agent makes a policy recommendation, which can then be accepted or rejected by an overseer whose policy goals differ from those of the agent. The theory suggests that both behavior and optimal institutional design are sensitive to several factors, including actors’ preference alignment, the importance of the policy decision, and the uncertainty about the correct policy choice. We characterize the types of situations in which ex post review creates incentives for the agent to make pathological policy choices. In these situations, ex post review can reduce accountability of the agent to overseer wishes and ultimately provide incentives to set aside review entirely. The theory also offers testable predictions about policy recommendations and the overseer’s acceptance or rejection of these recommendations."
“Not a Single Privilege Is Annexed to His Character”: Necessary and Proper Executive Privileges and Immunities,"In the anthropology of ethics there has been a growing interest in the concept of freedom, defined as the tool of consciousness that enables people to reflect on themselves and their circumstances, and make decisions about what they ought to do. The benefit of understanding freedom as a grounded ethical practice is that it allows us to appreciate how people constitute themselves through the choices they make. What this obscures, however, is an understanding of how freedom figures in situations where people no longer feel the need to consider what they ought to do and where choice becomes redundant. Through an exploration of nonviolent action in the 2011 Yemeni revolution, this essay proposes a notion of freedom as liberation from moral choice, where choice is a burden. It concludes by reconsidering the extent to which ethical thought can adequately account for the varieties of human freedom in different ethnographic contexts."
The burden of choice and the triumph of the event: Freedom in the Yemeni revolution,"Very little attention has been paid to the role of language in the Présence Africaine debates over British and French decolonization in the 1950s and early 1960s. My article fleshes out this history by exploring how key intellectuals connected to the journal and publishing house understood the relationship between race, decolonization, and language. First, I sketch out the historical context for these debates and explain the raison d’être of Présence Africaine as a journal and publishing house, focusing particularly on the interventions its editors sought to make. Then I connect these contexts to a discussion of the contributions of key intellectuals to the 1956 Présence Africaine Congress of Black Writers and Artists. While most of the participants in the 1956 congress agreed that language as a fundamental building block and conveyor of culture would be crucial to this project, they were far from reaching a consensus on how or why that would be the case. Their discussions went beyond choosing between particular languages to parsing out arguments for deploying language as a tool for managing the legacies of Western civilization and the status of particular cultures within understandings of modernity and human psychology. Questions of dialect and accent as indicators of race, for example, were analyzed alongside discussions about the nature of authentic language use and the power structures embedded in the configurations of different languages. These debates were refracted through the parallel question of how the canon of Western thought was (and continues to be) constituted."
"Charlotte Smith, William Hayley, and Discriminated Anguish","AbstractIn 1641, according to the vicar Thomas Johnson, Irish rebels in Mayo, in “meere hatred and derision of the English,” tried a group of English cattle for unspecified charges. They were convicted and executed. Many historians have pointed to this striking event as an example of the deep hatred underlying popular violence in the rebellion. The trials, however, were merely the most spectacular iteration of long-standing conflicts over transformations in animal husbandry between the Munster Plantation in the 1580s and the rebellion of the 1640s. The new pastoralism that emerged during these decades threatened traditional practices and landscapes while creating new vulnerabilities to poor weather and economic downturns. The combination of economic crises and harsh weather associated with the Little Ice Age exposed these vulnerabilities. The cow trials show that environmental forces shaped the 1641 Rebellion but demonstrate that historians assessing the impacts of climate and weather must attend to the social and economic contexts that produce vulnerability."
"Eliza Steinbock, Shimmering Images: Trans Cinema, Embodiment, and the Aesthetics of Change","In 1852, enslaved people’s great champion lampooned Americans who rejoiced on the Fourth of July while millions wore chains. Although widely lauded by historians, Frederick Douglass’s speech has not been placed in proper context. Indeed, as this article shows, Douglass participated in a holiday tradition that Black abolitionists established during the mid–nineteenth century. Tracing the formation of the tradition primarily in Black newspapers, this article reveals that as Black abolitionists grew troubled by the growing power of enslavers, they hosted celebrations to reimagine America as an antislavery, antiracist nation. Especially after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, they articulated an America cleansed of slavery and racism. When the US Civil War began, they continued the tradition yet also mobilized it to influence the direction of the war. This article details the evolution of Black abolitionists’ Fourth of July tradition and exposes the importance of American nationalism to Black abolitionist thinking."
"“La Langue de nos maîtres”: Linguistic Hierarchies, Dialect, and Canon Decolonization During and After the Présence Africaine Congress of 1956","After landmark Civil Rights legislation was implemented, scholars provided evidence that the nature and structure of whites’ racial attitudes changed from the Jim Crow era. They devised survey questions to capture newer, more acceptable forms of racial animus. One scale that came out of this effort and that receives the most empirical attention today is the racial resentment scale. Given the vast changes the American racial landscape has undergone since that scale was originally developed, we question whether this set of measures is related to racial attitudes in the same way across generational cohorts. We show two key findings: younger whites are not bringing about any meaningful change in the aggregate levels of racial resentment. Second, and more importantly, we show that while younger whites appear to have lower levels of racial resentment, these survey items are more strongly related to old-fashioned antiblack affect among younger whites. Thus, when it comes to millennials’ racial attitudes, “less is more.”"
Why Is It So Difficult to Love the World?,"The prohibition of dagga (cannabis) in South Africa, according to the Customs and Excise Duties Amendment Act No. 35 of 1922, affected Africans who had long-standing histories of dagga consumption as a part of everyday practice of their culture. Authorities worked to control the possession, cultivation, and use of dagga and to counter the illicit dagga economies that emerged during this period. Police annual records reveal a bigger picture of policing midcentury (1932–60), a period spanning the colonial and apartheid eras that saw significant changes in policies affecting civic liberties generally. Policing affected areas like the Transvaal and Natal provinces, based on geographical locations and racial groups, as the focus shifted from demand to supply in the 1950s. This article investigates three factors to account for the pattern of seizures and arrests in the 1950s: cannabis laws, changes in government from colonial to apartheid, and the 1952 report of the Interdepartmental Committee of the Abuse of Dagga."
"Cow Trials, Climate Change, and the Causes of Violence","While previous research evaluates how citizens’ perceptions of governing parties’ ideologies respond to party policy rhetoric and the composition of governing coalitions, no extant study addresses whether citizens cue off of government policy outputs. We calibrate citizens’ Left-Right party placements against data on government welfare policies in analyses of 15 party systems for 1973–2010. We identify a welfare generosity effect where governing parties’ images shift further left when welfare policies are more generous; moreover, the public appears to hold the current government accountable for the welfare regime it inherited, in addition to the welfare policy changes to this regime it has enacted since the last election. However, we find no evidence that citizens react to governments’ manifesto-based policy rhetoric, which suggests that citizens prioritize actual government policies, not words. These findings have implications for parties’ election strategies and for mass-elite linkages."
“Lighting Up the Path of Liberty and Justice”: Black Abolitionist Fourth of July Celebrations and the Promise of America from the Fugitive Slave Act to the Civil War,"“On Not Being Born: Contraceptive Experiments in Bangladesh in the Era of Demopower” traces the development of two abortion technologies created by lay abortionist Harvey Karman, their travel from America before Roe v. Wade to Bangladesh in the infancy of its postcolonial statehood, and their remarkable afterlives. One is celebrated as a technique of the contemporary global development apparatus, and the other is reviled as a debunked medical atrocity. Menstrual regulation, a lay abortion procedure for which Karman is known, is today the fourth most common form of contraception in the developing world. The other, the super coil method, which Karman tested on Black women in Philadelphia, was responsible for catastrophic injury. Read together, the lives of these two technologies offer an account of how experiments on women’s bodies in Bangladesh, as part of a humanitarian mission, justified catastrophic experimentation on Black women in America and became packaged into a narrative about the struggle for abortion as a singular right of American womanhood. This essay argues that menstrual regulation and its repudiated kin are techniques of what I call “demopolitics,” produced by demographic surveillance, monitoring, and abstraction that are financialized through an American foreign aid apparatus of debt. Not being born, in Bangladesh, is the goal of a global futurism that invests itself not in reproduction and the management of life but in contraception and the prevention of birth."
A cane and a Kaʿba model: Mediated experiences in the early modern Ottoman Empire,"This paper advances a heuristic distinction between “model” (in the Geertzian sense of “model-for”) and “example” as contrasting modes of articulating thought and action in the Anthropocene. I argue that the distinction is helpful in understanding the ontological presuppositions of geo-engineering as a technopolitical fix. Finally, I draw the outlines of a notion of “ontological anarchism” as the proper meta-mode of existence of the Anthropocene."
Less Is More: A Cross-Generational Analysis of the Nature and Role of Racial Attitudes in the Twenty-First Century,"The relationship between feminism and drag king performance is complicated. While many drag kings hail their performances as feminist, feminists critical of drag king performance often accuse drag kings of valorizing hegemonic masculinity, reinforcing patriarchal norms, or engaging in the subjugation of femininity through performances that use masculine tropes. In particular, strains of radical feminism that reify the connection between gender presentation and biological sex are unable to imagine a female-born person’s relationship to masculinity that is not about access to male privilege and the assertion of patriarchal ideologies within lesbian spaces. In opposition to this trend, many drag kings understand their performances as specifically feminist because they create a subcultural language and feminist-centered spaces. This counters the claim that femininity and biology correlate directly to each other and rejects the impulse to draw strict boundaries around the category of “woman.” This article intervenes in this conversation by asserting that drag king masculinity has aspects of feminist performance embedded in its structure. Drag kings manipulate gendered agency through both parody and reappropriations of hegemonic masculinity in ways that have the potential to act as subversive feminist performances. In light of these factors, I contend that even dominant masculinities can do the work of feminism when written onto the bodies of drag kings. Further, I propose that we reimagine the language we use to talk about drag king identity more generally. Most analyses of drag king culture follow J. Jack Halberstam’s understanding of drag kings as a representation of female masculinity. I suggest, instead, that we shift from talking about drag kings as embodying female masculinity to talking about drag kings as engaging feminist masculinities."
"Dagga and Data: Cannabis, Race, and Policing in Midcentury South Africa, 1932–1960","Legislators often must vote on complex issues that they do not fully understand. I show that legislators cope with incomplete information by taking cues from trusted peers who possess expertise that they themselves lack. With a matched differences-in-differences design that exploits midsession committee assignments as expertise-increasing events, I estimate that this behavior accounts for a substantial proportion of all congressional voting decisions. These cues cross party lines and remain relevant in the face of mounting partisan polarization. My findings highlight the salience of expertise to legislators and the role that ties between legislators play in allowing Congress to reach informed collective decisions."
Social Welfare Policy Outputs and Governing Parties’ Left-Right Images: Do Voters Respond?,"Leaders need resources to maintain power. To secure these resources, states can develop their own extractive capacity or seek external support to help subsidize their costs. In this study, we argue that extractive capacity and external support are not always alternatives. We focus on how US support can foster local property rights, which subsequently builds extractive capacity. We then argue that states with more capacity are better able to either alleviate rebels’ grievances or deter rebels from mounting a military challenge. We use mediation analysis to test these expectations with a data set on capacity, US support, and civil conflict from 1970 to 2012. We find empirical support for the role of property rights and capacity as mediating factors between US support and civil conflict. Our results have implications for international explanations of civil conflict and the role of US patronage in capacity development."
On Not Being Born: Contraceptive Experiments in the Era of Demopower,"Readers of Whitman’s poetry have long celebrated his radical portrayal of crossing racial boundaries. Yet, as recent scholars have documented, Whitman “erased” almost all of his references to black Americans in his Reconstruction-era writings. This article argues against the standard interpretation of this erasure, contending that it was a product of a rhetorical shift, rather than of Whitman’s increasing personal prejudice toward black Americans. By tracing Whitman’s rhetorical strategy from pre– to post–Civil War periods, I show that Whitman maintained a public commitment to a racially heterogeneous democracy. What changed, I argue, was his rhetorical approach. While Whitman’s prewar poetic experimentation was addressed to Americans more generally, his postwar writings were tailored to court the Americans who were least open to his democratic project—white Southerners. I conclude by examining the limitations of both rhetorical approaches, arguing that they point toward the need for a pluralist approach to social criticism."
"Repetition Run Riot: Refrains, Slogans, and Graffiti","In June 1968, the public affairs program Black Journal debuted on the National Educational Television (NET) network. While NET’s leadership initially claimed that they were unable to find suitably trained Black producers, in September the filmmaker William Greaves became the new executive producer of Black Journal. It was in this new capacity that Greaves would transform how African American issues were covered on television. Working with a young cohort of Black producers and technicians, Greaves imbued the program with a Pan-African sensibility that transcended the borders of the United States. This Black internationalist orientation, I argue, was fundamentally shaped by William Greaves’s own life and career but also produced by the collective labor of those men and women who used this new televisual medium to reconceive the terms of the civil rights struggle and Black Power. Building on a longer tradition of activism, Greaves helped to forge critical link different generations of Pan-African intellectuals, whose debates and deliberations found in Black Journal a new medium of Black internationalism."
On Models and Examples: Engineers and Bricoleurs in the Anthropocene,"Existing studies have portrayed a lack of broad-based solidarity as a major hurdle to sustained social mobilization. Examining Chinese veterans, this article contends that intragroup fragmentation within a social group can actually help sustain activism when in contention with authorities. This is achieved through a mechanism of “selective identification”: when subgroups make demands, they identify with better-off counterparts, while distancing themselves from veterans who are more disadvantaged. Through this, each successful gain achieved by one subgroup generates and legitimizes claims by other subgroups. Thus, intragroup divisions have not disempowered claimants but have been used as leverage against the government when making demands. This mechanism poses a dilemma for the government: a unified policy response to veteran groups agitating for better conditions is not accepted by groups that believe they deserve more, whereas a differentiated policy creates grievances among those who receive less. Both types of grievances can help mobilize and sustain collective action, even though veterans’ activism has declined in recent years because of a more repressive overall environment."
"Staging Dissents: Drag Kings, Resistance, and Feminist Masculinities","After 9/11, law enforcement agencies in Southern California attempted to implement trust and cooperation approaches toward Muslim communities as part of counterterrorism policing. Based on interviews with key law enforcement officials and Muslim community leaders, alongside analysis of legal cases, reports, and media coverage, we argue that these trust and cooperation approaches have failed for three main reasons. First, law enforcement agencies failed to separate community outreach and intelligence gathering, and second, local and federal agencies engaged in extensive coordination in the name of efficiency. Both of these actions have led to hostility and distrust within the Muslim communities. Finally, dissident values from the Muslim communities found little space within the trust and cooperation forums, thereby requiring them to challenge unfair practices from outside."
"Expertise, Networks, and Interpersonal Influence in Congress","Is culture a lasting driver of corruption? I study whether normative attitudes toward bribery persist through generational change. To disentangle cultural from institutional causes, I compare individuals who share an institutional environment but whose parents were born abroad. I find evidence of intergenerational persistence: average bribery attitudes in the parental country of ancestry explain variation in bribery attitudes across second-generation immigrants. Consistent with theoretical models, both family-based and community-based mechanisms of attitudinal transmission appear to matter, and cultural persistence appears to be greater in laxer environments. Finally, I find that bribery attitudes are associated with two measures of bribing behavior, highlighting the need to increase attention to cultural factors in corruption scholarship and policy."
"US Patronage, State Capacity, and Civil Conflict","While scholars have identified ways that racial conservatives exerted outsized influence on criminal justice policies, little attention has been paid to whether police departments have incentives to learn about and adopt reforms that reduce racial disparity. I present a game of imperfect information between residents and a municipal police chief to show that a chief’s inability to prevent officer behavior that residents perceive to be abusive, coupled with resident unwillingness to assist police in the aftermath of this behavior, creates an incentive for the chief to choose and learn about new policing strategies that rely less on resident assistance. This induces a bias in favor of aggressive over collaborative tactics in the police chief’s policy selection and learning decisions. Segregation and discrimination ensured that many black Americans lived in conditions that produced this result in the later twentieth century; thus, the model shows structural racism in local police policy making."
"Walt Whitman, White Revanchism, and the Dilemmas of Social Criticism","While there is disagreement as to the severity of the digital disinformation problem, scholars and practitioners have largely coalesced around the idea that a new system of safeguards is needed to prevent its spread. By minimizing the role of citizens in managing their own communities, however, I argue that these gatekeeping approaches are undemocratic. To develop a more democratic alternative, I draw from the work of Harold D. Lasswell and John Dewey to argue that we should study the organization of digital publics. For citizens to engage in democratic inquiry, publics must be organized so that they can (1) easily identify their common interests and (2) regularly encounter variety. I then analyze Facebook, showing how the News Feed and Facebook Groups together create a platform on which propagandists can effectively target and manipulate specific publics. I conclude by turning to Reddit to suggest alternative forms of organizing digital publics more democratically."
“Most Make No Memorable Impact”: Memory and Prosody in W. H. Auden’s Jagged Quatrains,"This introductory article outlines the general orientations of the Wenner-Gren Foundation’s 158th symposium held in Sintra, Portugal, in the autumn of 2018. It summarizes and reflects on the various communications and teases out how the entanglements of Atlantic slavery, knowledge production, and colonization shaped the modern world. It then contemplates a more equitable future through alternative problem-solving anthropology."
"Bernard E. Harcourt, Critique and Praxis: A Radical Critical Philosophy of Illusions, Values, and Actions","AbstractThis article examines the relationship between imperial hunting and the sublime through the historical analysis of race, caste, and aesthetics in the Central Himalayas. Reading Raja Rudra Deva's sixteenth-century Śyainika Śāstra against the career of nineteenth-century timber merchant Frederick Wilson, it argues that the bodies of the courtly hawker and the imperial sportsman simultaneously articulated and naturalized hierarchies of caste and race in the Central Himalayas. In the precolonial context, dramatic displays of hawking calibrated caste status but did not codify boundaries between ''nature'' and ''culture.'' In contrast, the aesthetics of the sublime were deployed in English hunting journals to demarcate racial difference and legitimate colonial rule in the Central Himalayas. The aesthetics of courtly hawking and imperial sportsmanship were thus consequential to the elaboration of race and caste-based forms of authority over the Himalayan environment."
"Producing a “Black World”: William Greaves, “Black Journal,” and the Creation of a New Medium of Black Internationalism, 1968–1970","When an ancient Greek dēmos deliberated, what did it do? Some say it engaged in public conversation; others, that a small number of active citizens debated before a larger, more passive audience. This article defends an alternative interpretation. Three models of deliberation appear in the ancient texts: internal, dialogical, and “audience,” in which speaking and deliberating were performed by advisers and decision-makers respectively. Assembly deliberation was almost always represented as audience deliberation. The dēmos deliberated (ἐβουλεύετο), i.e., came to a decision internally, while those who spoke before it advised (συνεβούλευσε)—with significant implications for our conceptualization of ancient Greek democracy."
Mobilizing without Solidarity: Sustained Activism among Chinese Veterans,"The commercial peace theory maintains that trade fosters peace because trade makes conflict more costly. However, focusing on dyadic trade or overall trade integration, previous studies provide an inaccurate picture of the material incentives that states face in the event of military conflict. Some, but not all, third parties create economic costs for combatants. In this article, I develop the idea of Extended Dependence. I argue that trade with a potential target’s allies promotes peace because those states may reduce trade with the challenger following military intervention, punish it by imposing economic sanctions, or undermine its ability to access alternative markets. Empirical analyses that cover 1951–2010 strongly support my arguments. Trade dependence on the prospective target or on the target’s nonaggression-pact partners, however, does not yield a similar effect. This article advances our understanding of how economic linkages and security institutions can work together to diminish interstate conflict."
Parallel and Intersecting Journeys with Michael Zuckert,"This paper examines whether propaganda broadcast over radio helped to change interethnic attitudes in postgenocide Rwanda. We exploit variation in exposure to the government’s radio propaganda due to the mountainous topography of Rwanda. Results of lab-in-the-field experiments show that individuals exposed to government propaganda have lower salience of ethnicity, have increased interethnic trust, and show more willingness to interact face-to-face with members of another ethnic group. Our results suggest that the observed improvement in interethnic behavior is not cosmetic and reflects a deeper change in interethnic attitudes. The findings provide some of the first quantitative evidence that the salience of ethnic identity can be manipulated by governments."
"Combatting Suspicion, Creating Trust: The Interface of Muslim Communities and Law Enforcement in the United States after 9/11","Greed-based theories of civil war predict that rebel groups will only engage in taxation and other state-building activities in areas where they lack exploitable resources. However, this prediction is contradicted by the Islamic State’s pattern of taxation across time and space. A new data set mapping seven types of revenue-extracting policies imposed by the Islamic State, a jihadist rebel group, in the 19 Syrian districts that it governed between 2013 and 2017 indicates that these policies were just as prevalent in resource-rich as in resource-poor districts. I propose a new theory that better explains this pattern—a rebel group’s pattern of taxation is codetermined by (1) ideology and (2) the costs of warfare—and establish the plausibility of this theory through a case study of al-Mayadin, the most oil-rich district governed by the Islamic State and therefore an ideal site in which to investigate the puzzle of taxation by resource-rich rebels."
The Culture of Corruption across Generations: An Empirical Study of Bribery Attitudes and Behavior,"I study a dynamic model of center-periphery relations that endogenizes the periphery’s grievance via the legacy of repression. The center’s key trade-off is that repression prevents the periphery from mobilizing today but increases grievances and thus the group’s ability to mobilize tomorrow, whereas tolerating mobilization diminishes grievances. The model’s predictions are path dependent, and a tipping point emerges among grievances. Below, the center tolerates mobilization, dissipating grievances. Above, the center preempts mobilization with perpetual repression or by granting independence, either intensifying grievances or breaking up the country, respectively. Only moderately aggrieved minorities have the opportunity and desire for mobilization. The model reconciles competing accounts of decentralization and secessionist mobilization, as the two have a nonmonotonic relationship; moderate decentralization levels are particularly susceptible to mobilization. Even decentralization optimally chosen by the center can be followed by outbursts of rebellion. The evolution of Basque secessionism helps to illustrate the model’s dynamics."
History and the Perils of Grand Strategy,"Regimes that exhibit authoritarian features while still retaining some traditional democratic institutions are on the rise. Even though such regimes have eliminated important constraints on executive power, some still feature an occasionally defiant judiciary. We provide a novel explanation for this phenomenon by focusing on the judiciary’s role as a potential source of valuable information to the government about divisions among the regime’s elites. Under certain conditions, a defiant judiciary is observed in equilibrium only if the resulting revelation about the strength of the elites would be sufficiently informative for the government to warrant reneging on its ex ante optimal policy. Intuitively, in the absence of a strong legislative opposition or a free media, occasional judicial defiance helps the government by more informatively balancing the interests of the voters and the elites. Our results contribute to the debates about the survival of defiant institutions in authoritarian regimes."
"Resident Assistance, Police Chief Learning, and the Persistence of Aggressive Policing Tactics in Black Neighborhoods","This article integrates literature on social movements and migration to examine how migration shapes both the cognitive and social foundations of collective action in origin communities. Using longitudinal data and in-depth interviews from rural China, the author finds that outward migration spurs collective resistance in origin communities and shapes the form and scale of collective action. Migration fosters noninstitutionalized rather than institutionalized collective action, because it induces relational diffusion that empowers peasants to mobilize and employ more effective resistance strategies. This holds more for small- and medium-size collective action than for large-scale mobilizations, mainly because out-migration can also trigger community disintegration that inhibits larger-scale action. Furthermore, local social institutions condition the role of migration: migration has a stronger positive impact in close-knit villages embedded in strong lineage networks than in less cohesive villages. The author contextualizes the findings against the distinct institutional arrangements in China, which were originally engineered to disenfranchise rural-origin people but which instead have inadvertently politicized migrants and peasants alike."
Feminism for the Americas: The Making of an International Human Rights Movement by Katherine M. Marino,"Over the last three decades, fruitful new lines of research and theorizing have revealed the inadequacy of secularization and rational choice explanations of religion. This article argues that sociological understandings of religion can best advance now by building on the empirical findings that have emerged under the banner of “lived religion,” but grounding that work in theories of social practice. Going beyond the Western, individualist focus of recent research, the approach explicated in this article details a multidimensional lens for the study of the practices themselves and an outline of the types of historical and legal cultural repertoires that shape practice around the world. Together these frameworks can facilitate sociological research on religion both inside and beyond religious institutions and across cultural contexts."
"Extending the Domain of Freedom, or Why Gaia Is So Hard to Understand","This keynote speech for “Changing Minds: Societies, States, the Science and Psychoactive Substances in History,” the annual meeting of the Alcohol and Drugs History Society, was delivered on Thursday, June 13, 2019, at Shanghai University in China. Drawing attention to the knowledge questions embedded in the harm reduction movement, this talk examines how naloxone—a narcotic antagonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971 to reverse opioid overdose—came to matter for the harm reduction movement in the United States. The talk situated naloxone as a “technology of solidarity” useful for animating lively selves, in contrast with previous uses of narcotic antagonists for surveillance and social control. During the 1990s and early 2000s, activists, advocates, and researchers moved naloxone from its relatively settled status within a medical enclave to the unsettled status of a commodity for mass distribution."
"Beyond Gatekeeping: Propaganda, Democracy, and the Organization of Digital Publics","One unresolved question in the scholarship on James Wilson concerns the relationship between his natural law jurisprudence and Christianity. Engaging that debate, this article marshals evidence for the continuity of Wilson’s lectures with the Christian natural law tradition. Indeed, Wilson’s lectures offer a vision of founding-era jurisprudence that is self-consciously rooted in a divinely created and rationally intelligible moral order that is both complemented and presupposed by Christian revelation. By highlighting the essential continuity between the Christian natural law tradition and the first and most prominent lectures on early American jurisprudence, this article challenges a common interpretive framework that sees the founding in general, and Wilson’s lectures in particular, as subtly subversive of Christianity."
Langston Hughes and the Literary Ca(u)se against Jim Crow,"Terrorism prevention is a priority for most democratic polities; however, governments are often unable to precisely assess the threat posed by various terrorist groups. How does a government’s uncertainty about terrorists’ capacity affect the probability of a terror attack occurring? We develop a game-theoretic model to show that the probability of a successful terrorist attack increases when the government expects to face a terror group with low rather than high capacity for violence. This novel result has important implications for how we evaluate the performance of governments and the security agencies in charge of terrorism prevention."
"Atlantic Slavery and the Making of the Modern World: Experiences, Representations, and Legacies: An Introduction to Supplement 22","We contribute to literature in public opinion on policy feedback effects by examining how the existence of a women’s police station (WPS) in the place of residence influences citizens’ attitudes toward gender-based violence. With a focus on WPS, we argue that public policies implemented at the local level that criminalize violence against women (VAW) and increase survivors’ access to specialized services are particularly likely to promote attitudes among men that condemn VAW. We find that, in Brazil, men are more likely to reject VAW and support bystander intervention in municipalities with WPS, especially if WPS have been operating for a long time. Further analyses suggest that these findings are neither endogenous nor merely driven by social desirability bias or a deterrence effect. Men’s improved attitudes go hand in hand with lower rates of intimate partner violence. The results have important implications for the implementation of public policies to prevent VAW."
"Imperial Hunting and the Sublime: Race, Caste, and Aesthetics in the Central Himalayas","The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, was founded during the period of détente in 1972 to bring scientists from East and West together to research shared problems and thus to build a “bridge” between the two opposed systems. The underlying image of knowledge at the institute was in stark contrast to the intellectual culture established in East Germany. Contributing to our understanding of the history of Cold War knowledge transfer, this essay reconstructs East Germany’s ambivalent and complex role at IIASA. Even if participation was considered important for displaying East German science, the essay argues that East Germany’s contribution was caught up in the perception of the Western scholar as a class enemy. It illustrates this by examining the best-documented case: that of Harry Maier, a social scientist who spent two years at IIASA between 1978 and 1980 and then, in 1986, used a conference visit to escape from East Germany."
Deliberation in Ancient Greek Assemblies,"Hubert Harrison (1883–1927) represents a pioneer of the Black radical tradition whose historical restoration requires us to rethink the origins of the Garvey movement. Harrison and his Liberty League of Negro-Americans modeled many of the key strategic, ideological, and cultural components that Garvey would adopt for his Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA), including the United States and Harlem in particular as a headquarters, the focus on mass social movement building, the ideology of “race first,” support for nationalist struggles like the Irish, and a tricolor flag to symbolize Black liberation. At a time when Marcus Garvey was on the verge of returning to Jamaica, he caught a break by joining forces with Harrison in Harlem. As a result, Harrison’s organization exerted a decisive influence on Garvey, prompting him to shift his vision for the UNIA from a Tuskegee Institute emulator to a vehicle for building a global Pan-African and Black nationalist social movement."
"Extended Dependence: Trade, Alliances, and Peace","This article explores the campaign for Protestant church reform in Alsace-Lorraine on the eve of the First World War. In 1909, the Lutheran Church adopted a major reform project that it asked the state to sanction; one year later the Reformed Church decided to follow suit. In these proposals, the two communities strove to redefine themselves in ways that would facilitate accomplishing their missions in contemporary times. The campaigns thus shed valuable light on how churches and faith communities were reimagining themselves as social institutions at the beginning of the twentieth century. Critically, extant law inherited from the French granted the territorial government sole authority to reform the Protestant churches, which reminds us that even circa 1900 European states remained intimately involved in religious and ecclesiastical affairs. Alsace-Lorraine’s leaders were prepared to grant the Protestant churches greater autonomy in their internal affairs, but they refused to countenance any major reworking of church-state relations, largely because this would have raised questions about the state’s prerogatives vis-à-vis the region’s Catholic Church. By mid-1913, a compromise had been reached, but the delays proved fatal. The Zabern crisis in December 1913 and the First World War soon sidelined the churches’ constitutional projects, and after 1918 the French government showed no interest in reviving them."
"Erasing Ethnicity? Propaganda, Nation Building, and Identity in Rwanda","Imperial ideology identified “science” and “progress” as the prerogative of the “West,” while “religion” and “spirituality” were located in the “East.” Yet, in practice, these neat dichotomies were far more difficult to sustain. Science and religion were braided together by spiritually inquisitive scientists as much in the West as in the East. Various strands of hylozoic thought that undermined the dichotomy of matter and spirit were located in the liminal space between these orthogonal categories. One such strand of hylozoism, engendered in electromagnetic ideas, was articulated in the early science fiction of authors like Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Dinendrakumar Ray, a Bengali novelist, inserted this science-fictional hylozoism into his translations of the novels of the Australian author Guy Boothby. By selectively adapting and blending Boothby’s international plot lines with Lytton-like electromagnetic hylozoism, Ray was able to craft a “hylozoic anticolonialism” that resonated emphatically with the thought of Sri Aurobindo, a revolutionary nationalist turned neo-Hindu spiritual master."
After Labor,"Why do some dictatorships face dissent while others do not? In this article, we argue that nominally democratic institutions created to co-opt the dictatorial opposition have different effects on the likelihood of elite and collective dissent. By providing concessions through the creation of parties and legislatures, dictators reduce the probability of elite mobilization (via a coup) against the regime. For everyday citizens, the creation of nominally democratic institutions has the opposite effect, increasing citizen grievances and helping citizens overcome the collective action problem associated with dissent. We find empirical support for our expectations: nominally democratic institutions are negatively associated with the likelihood of coups and positively associated with the likelihood of collective dissent. Our findings suggest that the creation of “democratic” institutions may sometimes threaten dictatorial rule rather than insulate it."
The Byzantine Concept of “Syria” as Arab Empire and its Ancient Roots,"For the past 50 years, Bernard Bailyn’s The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967) and Gordon S. Wood’s The Creation of the American Republic (1969) have dominated scholarship on the American Revolution. Surely, though, it should not be the case today that the best books on the Revolution were written in the 1960s. This article develops a new methodological approach to the study of history, one that I call the “new moral history.” This new approach should be viewed as an alternative to the dominant school of historical thought of the past 50 years—the so-called ideological approach associated with Bailyn and Wood. This article will, first, present and critique the “ideological” approach to the study of the Revolution and, second, present an outline of the new moral history."
What Explains Taxation by Resource-Rich Rebels? Evidence from the Islamic State in Syria,"The popularity of drug-sniffing dogs since the 1970s rests on the contributions of a dying technological movement—counterinsurgency science. A comparison of two drug-sniffing dog programs—the Federal Bureau of Narcotics’s detective dog of the 1940s and 1950s, and the Department of Defense’s detector dog of the 1960s and 1970s—documents how federal agents failed to institutionalize drug-sniffing dogs, while Department of Defense researchers succeeded. The disparate outcomes of the two programs illustrate, first, the contingent institutional factors involved in adopting dogs for drug control, and second, the fragile institutional relationships supporting counterinsurgency science and new drug-control strategies after the Vietnam War."
When Things Fall Apart: The Impact of Global Governance on Civil Conflicts,"How do state and protester violence affect whether protests grow or shrink? Previous research finds conflicting results for how violence affects protest dynamics. This article argues that expectations and emotions should generate an n-shaped relationship between the severity of state repression and changes in protest size the next day. Protester violence should reduce the appeal of protesting and increase the expected cost of protesting, decreasing subsequent protest size. Since testing this argument requires precise measurements, a pipeline is built that applies convolutional neural networks to images shared in geolocated tweets. Continuously valued estimates of state and protester violence are generated per city-day for 24 cities across five countries, as are estimates of protest size and the age and gender of protesters. The results suggest a solution to the repression-dissent puzzle and join a growing body of research benefiting from the use of social media to understand subnational conflict."
"Decentralization, Repression, and Gambling for Unity","Studies have shown that violent, unwanted, and coerced sexual intercourse remains a common, normalized experience for many women in heterosexual relationships. While some studies have examined gender-based violence in South Africa, particularly in the form of physical abuse or intimate partner violence, no previous work has simply asked Black married women how they make sense of coercive sexual experiences, or even rape, nor inquired why they continue to tolerate these experiences despite the rights and dignity guaranteed by the South African Constitution. This question is important in the context of marriages where ilobolo (bride wealth) has been paid. With the payment of ilobolo, a new set of expectations regarding sexuality for married women emerges. It is within the context of these new expectations that this study seeks to explore sexual violence, such as marital rape, and women’s agency. By analyzing qualitative narratives from semistructured interviews with Black married South African women between the ages of forty and sixty-two from rural and township areas, we examine how these women interpret experiences of rape and sexual coercion in their intimate relationships with their husbands. The analysis centers on the women’s experiences and perceptions, and it illuminates that these Black married women see their bodies, and by extension their sexuality, as belonging to their husbands, especially because ilobolo was paid for them when they got married. A significant finding of this study is that very few women see sexual coercion as a problem that needs to be remedied, and this is encouraged by their families. Instead, the Black women in this study make sense of sexual violence within marriage in various ways. These include beliefs about how to behave as a woman in marriage, notions of self-sacrifice for the family’s stability, and for some, outright refusal when they are not interested in sex. Ultimately, the study explores some contradictory ways in which women assume their sexual agency in marriage while simultaneously engaging in unwanted and forced sex."
A Theory of Defiant Courts in Nondemocratic Regimes,"In 1970 the Urban League of Cleveland, Ohio, opened a “street academy,” an alternative school for public school dropouts. A street academy would reduce the dropout rate, prepare black youth for college, and develop a pilot program to transform urban public schools. Street academies also promoted an alternative vision of black youth after a decade when many Americans perceived them as “social dynamite,” delinquents, and rioters. This article explores how the Cleveland street academy’s efforts to achieve educational equality for black youth ended in failure as crime control became increasingly entangled with education. Tracing the Cleveland street academy’s history reveals how education and the criminalization of black youth became linked through the linchpin of the dropout. The academy’s inability to advance its understanding of black youth and reform public education illuminates the late twentieth-century processes framing urban youth as problems, underscoring the interplay between those processes, the diminished likelihood of educational equity, and mass incarceration."
"Empowerment or Disintegration? Migration, Social Institutions, and Collective Action in Rural China","Over the past decade, a large number of extremist and hate groups have turned to internet platforms to inspire mass violence. Currently, there is little reliable evidence on how such campaigns radicalize targeted audiences. We provide systematic, large-scale, microevidence on the effect of Islamic State propaganda on social media. We use several machine learning algorithms to detect recruitment messages in online propaganda, identify their dissemination on Twitter, and quantify the reactions of exposed users. Analyzing content produced by the Islamic State between 2015 and 2016 shows that propaganda conveying the material, spiritual, and social benefits of joining ISIS increased online support for the group, while content displaying brutal violence decreased endorsement of ISIS across a wide range of videos. Only the group’s most extreme supporters reacted positively to violent propaganda."
Cosmopolitanizing Colonial Memories in Germany,"What makes coercion succeed? For most international relations scholars, the answer is credible threats. Yet scholars have neglected a second key component of successful coercion: credible assurances. This article makes two contributions to our understanding of coercion and credible assurances. First, we offer a theoretical framework exploring the causes and consequences of assurance credibility. In order to coerce the target, a challenger must issue both credible threats that defiance will be met with punishment, and credible assurances that compliance will be met with restraint. In turn, the credibility of assurances is determined by power and a reputation for restraint. Whereas greater power boosts credible threats, it undermines credible assurances. Therefore, powerful states must cultivate a reputation for restraint in order to issue credible assurances. Second, we provide empirical support for our claims through a nationally representative, scenario-based survey experiment that explores how US citizens respond to a hypothetical coercive dispute with China."
Rethinking Religion: Toward a Practice Approach,"What leads elites to break their democratic commitments? How do the partisan loyalties and democratic values of citizens influence these choices? This article formally analyzes incumbent abuse in democracies, the most common modern initiator of democratic breakdown. If an incumbent attempts to consolidate power, the opposition can try to rally protest but can also cry wolf without incumbent abuse. In a democratic equilibrium, incumbents avoid abuse, the opposition calls for protest if and only if abuse occurs, and citizens protest in sufficient numbers to deter elites. Results show that non-winner-take-all institutions, high media accuracy, low partisanship, and citizen support for democracy typically promote democratic survival. However, under some conditions, higher democracy support can threaten democracy. Model extensions allow incumbents to pursue democratic erosion instead of full breakdown, promote “fake news,” and strategically inflame partisanship. The article explores several implications for democratic survival and incumbent strategies for subverting it."
Just Say Know: A Social History of How Naloxone Came to Matter,"Who gets The Real in realism? Taking as case studies three women-centered cable TV shows, this essay aims to renegotiate the terms of realism along feminist lines. In their focus on the ordinary and domestic, on proximate bodies and intimate conversations, Broad City, Insecure, and Girls echo the quotidian concerns of the nineteenth-century realist novel. Beyond this, in their signature use of the bathroom, they echo late Victorian efforts to push past the accepted limits of the “real” to explore matters conventionally hidden and beneath consideration. Abbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, Issa Rae, and Lena Dunham turn for reality effects to the “ugly” and typically unseen aspects of women’s daily lives: objects from tampons to toilets, shameful bodily functions, imperfect and vulnerable bodies, confused and embarrassing feelings. While all three shows exemplify a women-centered bathroom realism (in contrast to male-centered works for which violence is the key to a grittier realism), their particular strategies are differentiated by race. Jacobson, Glazer, and Dunham give us white women sprawled on toilets and tubs, trashing the ideal of proper ladyness. Rae’s bathroom fixture of choice is a mirror, a device she uses to explore the neglected terrain of Black female interiority."
"Reason, Revelation, and the Law of Nature in James Wilson’s Lectures on Law","Donald Trump has articulated foreign policy ideas at variance with the prior status quo of liberal internationalism. Trump’s status as an ideological outsider poses an interesting question: Can an executive institutionalize unorthodox foreign policy ideas in the face of bureaucracies dedicated to an alternative set of norms? This article argues that the Trump administration has failed to create new institutions or reorganize existing foreign policy bureaucracies to better serve its policy aims. Trump’s brand of populism succeeds more in the weakening of bureaucracies embodying liberal internationalism than in the creation of populist alternatives. While the institutional foundations for populism are likely to remain weak in the future, this administration’s erosion of existing institutions will make any post-Trump restoration of liberal internationalism a difficult enterprise. This suggests that the literature on bureaucratic control cannot treat all ideas equally. Some ideas are likelier to thrive in a de-institutionalized environment than others."
Counterterrorism Policy in an Uncertain World,"Globalization has complicated comparative research. What I call the connective and the integrative moments of globalization influence the comparative gesture differently; while one erodes the boundaries of the case, that is, of the empirical core of comparative research, the other makes comparison theoretically more plausible. Drawing on the heterogeneous epistemologies and histories of disciplines, which ultimately underlie passions for or against comparison, these two moments foster different intellectual endeavors—transnational and global approaches—often set up in opposition. I propose a more synthetic framework of oscillating comparison, which draws equally on the connective and integrative aspects of globalization, engaging the corresponding critical insights in a more productive dialogue. The article outlines a composite strategy that oscillates between different levels and forms of comparison and merges into an overarching framework the transnational approach (through case extension) and the global approach (through incorporated comparison) while expanding the practice of comparative research."
David Cahan’s Helmholtz: History of Science in European History,"In 1865, an overly aggressive missionary in the Kabyle mountains of French Algeria was tricked into sitting in human excrement, publicly humiliated by the tribe he hoped to convert. Or was he? Historians of French Algeria have recounted this story as confirmation of the scholarly consensus: that public missions to Muslims were either nonexistent or delusional and short-lived in the early decades of French Algeria. But these historians have relied on a version of the incident that was authored by an unsympathetic military administrator. This article argues that the excremental incident in Kabylie—and the competing versions of what happened there—should be understood as a site of contestation between missionaries and militaires over ethnographic authority, over who had the right to speak for the Kabyles. The incident also became a site of competing discourses about the role of religion in Muslim society and in the civilizing process. While missionaries wanted to convert indigenous Algerians to Christianity, they nevertheless admired and wanted to maintain what they perceived as the Muslims’ natural religiosity. Military administrators, conversely, insisted that while Algerians should not be pressured to convert, they should be taught to domesticate and interiorize their religious sentiments. Missionary efforts to convert Algeria’s Muslims were more frequent and sustained than previous scholarship has allowed. And although they may have been unsuccessful, these efforts generated a fertile but hitherto neglected archive of how French Catholics have thought about Islam, and of how Algeria’s Muslims exploited and navigated between missionaries and militaires."
Epidemic Years: A Third Look,"At least four observationally equivalent theories argue that federal judges follow public opinion when they decide cases. Yet there is mixed empirical support for these theories. Using recently released data on public opinion, we discover that state public opinion exerts a meaningful impact on the votes of federal circuit court judges. Perhaps more important, we leverage a number of different empirical approaches to identify which theory the data support. The data suggest that circuit court judges may change along with society but also that they follow public opinion because they care about their reputations in their home states."
Beyond Syncretism and Colonial Legacies in the Study of Religion: Critical Reflections on Harrison’s In Praise of Mixed Religion and Blanes’s A Prophetic Trajectory,"Recent scholarship has claimed Adam Smith’s frontal attack on the mercantile system as a precocious expression of liberal anti-imperialism. This article argues that settler colonialism in North America represented an important exception and limit to Smith’s anti-imperial commitments. Smith spared agrarian settler colonies from his invective against other imperial practices like chattel slavery and trade monopolies because of the colonies’ evidentiary significance for his “system of natural liberty.” Smith’s embrace of settler colonies involved him in an ideological conundrum insofar as the prosperity of these settlements rested on imperial expansion and seizure of land from Native Americans. Smith navigated this problem by, first, predicating colonial “injustice” on conquest, slavery, and destruction and, second, describing American land as res nullius. Together, these conceptual definitions made it possible to imagine settler colonies as originating in nonviolent acts of “occupation without conquest” and embodying “commerce without empire.”"
"Steven Connor, Giving Way: Thoughts on Unappreciated Dispositions","Objective: Initiatives to curb police abuse in the                     United States are often viewed as “antipolice” or politically                     unpopular. Efforts to address police violence may be more acceptable if abusive                     practices are shown to have an adverse impact on officers themselves. This study                     investigates potential associations between involvement in abusive policing                     practices and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among active-duty police                     officers in the United States. Method: We used                     Qualtrics Panels to recruit active-duty police officers in the U.S.                         (N = 137). Linear regression was used to model                     associations between abusive police practices and PTSD, adjusting for adverse                     childhood experiences (ACEs) and workplace trauma.                             Results: Approximately 11% of police                     officers self-reported involvement in abusive police practices. Abusive police                     practices were independently associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms                         (B = 0.22, p = 0.008) even                     when controlling for ACEs and workplace trauma.                             Conclusions: Officers who engage in                     abusive policing are more likely to report PTSD symptoms. Findings suggest that                     reducing police violence may benefit both officers and civilians. Further,                     mental health interventions targeting police officers may reduce the likelihood                     of police abuse."
State Action to Prevent Violence against Women: The Effect of Women’s Police Stations on Men’s Attitudes toward Gender-Based Violence,"Cannabis is legal to purchase for over 28 percent of U.S. citizens. A central argument used in public campaigns for cannabis legalization has focused on the tax revenue that legal cannabis markets could generate. Recently, some policy makers and politicians have debated switching from traditional ad valorem taxes to taxes on potency, aiming to reduce the potential externalities associated with highly potent products. In this paper, we construct a theoretical model to predict the implications of a potency-based tax in an environment with market power. We then estimate the demand for cannabis potency based on administrative records of sales and potency from Washington state. We finish by conducting counterfactual analyses comparing revenue and potency outcomes from potency-based taxes versus the traditional price-based taxes."
How Western Science Corrupts Class Consciousness: East Germany’s Presence at IIASA,"In this essay, I offer some thoughts on the problem of self-reflexivity in critical theory, with special attention to the way in which this problem is thematized in The Authoritarian Personality (1950). The problem of self-reflexivity is a defining feature of any social theory that means to account for the conditions of its own possibility within the society it describes. I argue that The Authoritarian Personality is less a study of distinctive and socially isolable personality “types” and more concerned with the rise of “conventionalism” as a generalized problem that afflicts all of modern society. In this respect the book shares in common a major focus on the problem of conformity that was also studied by other classic mid-century works of sociology. The question of conventionalism, however, brings into sharp relief a dilemma of self-reflexivity, namely, how can the researchers account for their own critical posture if the world they describe encourages conventionalism and disables criticism? By examining Adorno’s comments on the themes of realism and utopia and the distribution of these attributes between high-scorers and low-scorers, respectively, I offer one possible answer to this dilemma."
The Making of a Man of Science: Darwin’s Development in a Transformative Time,"With Detroit as its principal site, this essay examines the possibility and the hope for developing a decolonial practice as part of the research in and of a “Black” city. What can we learn from Detroit and what needs to change about ethnography in order for this kind of learning to take place? Can ethnography become a decolonial form or must it be undone and re-emerge as a different kind of intervention in order to effectively contribute to a decolonizing practice? Who should be the interlocutors? Who should be the authors? To what extent must we reimagine the audience? How must ethnography’s practitioners reconfigure processes of collaboration in order to effectively change the form?"
Just Responsibility: A Human Rights Theory of Global Justice by Brooke A. Ackerly,"This article reports results from a field experiment exploring how judicial behavior is affected by complaints about conflicts of interest. The conflicts of interest studied here arise in Wisconsin civil trial cases. Using public records, we identify instances in which one party’s attorney contributed to the presiding judge’s previous election campaign. We send a random subset of these judges a letter identifying the potential conflict and requesting recusal. We find that highlighting the potential conflict and asking judges to recuse sharply increases the rate at which judges disclose this relationship in court records but does not lead them to recuse. Furthermore, treated judges are no more likely to disclose or recuse in subsequent cases that present a similar conflict of interest. This experiment, which is the first to test possible remedies to judicial conflicts of interest, suggests that light touch interventions are insufficient to change judges’ behavior."
Pebbles and Ripples: Hubert Harrison and the Rise of the Garvey Movement,"In a laboratory setting, we explore strategic discrimination in principal-agent relationships, which arises from mutually reinforcing expectations of identity-contingent choices. Our experimental design isolates the influence of the strategic environment from effects of other sources of discrimination, including statistical differences between subpopulations and outright prejudice. We find that, in a strategic setting, principals who reward agents on the basis of outcomes more readily attribute high performance to effort when they share the agent’s group identity. No such bias exists either for principals whose reward decisions are outcome independent or for principals in a nonstrategic environment. Agents in the strategic setting tend to anticipate higher demands from out-group principals and condition their effort choice on that expectation. Because they underappreciate this conditionality, principals tend to underestimate the effort from out-group agents."
In search of origins: Making Etruscans into Italics and Italics into Italians,"As a novelist, playwright, and essayist James Baldwin is recognized as an important figure in American letters. In this article, I make the case for Baldwin as a resource for those wishing to develop the themes, concepts, and ontologies underlying philosophies of recognition, within the contemporary American context. I argue that because he places injustice and failures of recognition at the heart of American lives—both public and private—Baldwin enables theorists to acknowledge, first, the important functions performed by misrecognition, second, the work that needs to be done for Americans to achieve some kind of ethical minimum, and finally, the risks and dangers attendant to failing to take this work seriously."
"The Ties That Bind: Church-State Relations and Protestant Ecclesiastical Reform in Alsace-Lorraine, 1890–1914","Scholars in both digital humanities and media studies have noted an apparent disconnect between computation and the interpretive methods of the humanities. Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a “meaning problem” due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth’s arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet’s that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning—a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century."
"“Strange Intelligence”: Humans, Nonhumans, and History in Macbeth","This article reopens for the purpose of closing the long-standing debate over Locke’s influence on Jefferson, the Declaration of Independence, and the formation of America’s revolutionary mind. Its aim is to shed new light with new evidence on this rather timeworn controversy. In particular, I examine the sources and purposes of the Declaration from an entirely new perspective, that is, from the perspective of Jefferson’s post-1800 contemporaries. Rather than viewing Locke’s ideas from the front end, that is, by elucidating the genealogy of ideas extending from Locke (and others) to Jefferson and the Declaration, this article examines Locke’s influence on Jefferson and the Declaration from the back end, that is, by examining how early nineteenth-century Americans viewed Locke’s influence on Jefferson and the writing of the Declaration. It should matter, after all, how Jefferson’s fellow Americans understood what the Declaration was all about."
Seen Like a State,"Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
Introduction,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”","This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","We test whether emphasizing foreign aid’s ability to advance donor national interests increases public support for aid. We compare appeals to the national interest with other approaches, including highlighting aid’s ability to help developing countries. Tests involved a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment in which the treatments were vignettes about a major real aid project. Central among our findings were asymmetric treatment effects. It was easier to reduce the view that too much aid is given than to increase the belief that too little is given. Only appeals to the national interest were reliably able to do the latter. The efficacy of the different treatments varied depending on participant ideology, although in unexpected ways."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
Introduction,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”","This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","We test whether emphasizing foreign aid’s ability to advance donor national interests increases public support for aid. We compare appeals to the national interest with other approaches, including highlighting aid’s ability to help developing countries. Tests involved a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment in which the treatments were vignettes about a major real aid project. Central among our findings were asymmetric treatment effects. It was easier to reduce the view that too much aid is given than to increase the belief that too little is given. Only appeals to the national interest were reliably able to do the latter. The efficacy of the different treatments varied depending on participant ideology, although in unexpected ways."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
Introduction,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”","This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","We test whether emphasizing foreign aid’s ability to advance donor national interests increases public support for aid. We compare appeals to the national interest with other approaches, including highlighting aid’s ability to help developing countries. Tests involved a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment in which the treatments were vignettes about a major real aid project. Central among our findings were asymmetric treatment effects. It was easier to reduce the view that too much aid is given than to increase the belief that too little is given. Only appeals to the national interest were reliably able to do the latter. The efficacy of the different treatments varied depending on participant ideology, although in unexpected ways."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
Introduction,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”","This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","We test whether emphasizing foreign aid’s ability to advance donor national interests increases public support for aid. We compare appeals to the national interest with other approaches, including highlighting aid’s ability to help developing countries. Tests involved a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment in which the treatments were vignettes about a major real aid project. Central among our findings were asymmetric treatment effects. It was easier to reduce the view that too much aid is given than to increase the belief that too little is given. Only appeals to the national interest were reliably able to do the latter. The efficacy of the different treatments varied depending on participant ideology, although in unexpected ways."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
Introduction,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”","This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","We test whether emphasizing foreign aid’s ability to advance donor national interests increases public support for aid. We compare appeals to the national interest with other approaches, including highlighting aid’s ability to help developing countries. Tests involved a nationally representative, randomized survey experiment in which the treatments were vignettes about a major real aid project. Central among our findings were asymmetric treatment effects. It was easier to reduce the view that too much aid is given than to increase the belief that too little is given. Only appeals to the national interest were reliably able to do the latter. The efficacy of the different treatments varied depending on participant ideology, although in unexpected ways."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
"Red Crescents: Race, Genetics, and Sickle Cell Disease in the Middle East","Historical accounts of sickle cell disease tend to emphasize either its theoretical role in catalyzing the field of medical genetics or its clinical and social significance in representing the health-care disparities experienced by African Americans. This essay bridges these narratives by focusing on the discovery of sickle cells in marginalized Arabic-speaking communities of Yemen and Turkey in the 1950s. As in North America, sickle cell research in the Middle East unfolded along the social fractures of race. The essay analyzes how British, Turkish, and Arab geneticists attempted to create evolutionary hypotheses that reconciled historical and sociological boundaries between white and African, Arab and Turk. As the parameters of Turkish and Arab nationalism shifted in the Cold War–era Middle East, so did the favored explanatory narratives for the presence of sickle cells in different communities, which assigned different degrees of importance to African ancestry, socially enforced endogamy, and evolutionary adaptations to malaria."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
"A Migrant’s Lotería: Risk, Fortune, Fate, and Probability in the Borderlands of Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems","This article examines the relation between risk and migration, especially as presented in Juan Felipe Herrera and Artemio Rodríguez’s poetry-linocut collaboration Lotería Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives (1999). In its reading of this work, this article considers the risk analysis of contemporary global migration not from the dehumanizing standards of probability theory (and the science of demographics or the practice of making norms out of numbers that emerges from probabilistic thinking). Rather, it engages with older (pre-Pascalian) figurations of risk, such as fortune, fate, influence, and divination. Its inquiry is thus located in two main historical contexts—the literature and arts of contemporary inter-American migration (especially from Central American and Mexico to the United States) and the European Renaissance, in which the theorization of such figures as fortune, fate, and foresight was robust and related to colonial projects in the Americas. In recasting inter-American migration in more humanistic conceptions of risk, this article aims to rethink futurity from the losses and possibilities that flash up in migrant horizons."
Democracy Does Cause Growth,"We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health."
Biopolitics in the Time of Coronavirus,"We argue that most survey measures of partisanship are misclassifying many respondents as nonpartisans. Common wordings, especially those in major cross-national surveys, violate well-established best practices in questionnaire design by reading aloud a nonpartisanship option. This is akin, we show, to the taboo of inviting no-opinion responses. Consequently, most wordings produce high rates of false negatives, meaning respondents with partisan leanings who nonetheless choose the nonpartisan response. Our analysis of experimental and observational data from four countries (Brazil, Mexico, Russia, United States) shows that nearly a quarter of respondents are false negatives when read an easy nonpartisan opt out. More importantly, we demonstrate, using item response theory and other measurement checks, that wordings that remedy this problem by not inviting nonpartisan responses have greater measurement validity. Our findings show that scholars are underestimating the prevalence of partisanship and that harbors for false negatives can exist in unexpected forms."
"Neetu Khanna, The Visceral Logics of Decolonization","Scholars have argued that leaders pay domestic audience costs for backing down from a prior position. We challenge this argument theoretically and methodologically. We argue that scholars have erred by measuring “costs” exclusively through disapproval of a leader’s handling of the situation when general job approval more accurately reflects audience cost theory. This distinction matters because Americans often have strong existing opinions of the president, such that situational disapproval does not damage general approval. We also argue that the use of hypothetical leaders compounds this problem. We test these assertions using two experiments. Our primary design examines approval for both a hypothetical president, as is common in the literature, and the then-sitting president, President Obama. Our secondary design allows us to alter the president’s partisanship. The results strongly support our theory, suggesting scholars have missed an important piece of the puzzle by focusing on situational approval for hypothetical leaders."
Nonpartisans as False Negatives: The Mismeasurement of Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys,"The United States often applies its laws to conduct or persons in foreign countries. How do these countries respond to US extraterritorial pressure? This study examines a central case of extraterritoriality: the protection of US troops from criminal justice in troop-hosting countries. I argue that greater security dependence on the United States brings hosts to comply with US pressure—when such compliance receives limited public attention. This argument is tested through a microlevel analysis of host countries’ treatment of US personnel who committed criminal offenses during the Cold War (1954–70). The results suggest that in countries dependent on US-provided security, American troops were less likely to face trial. Yet if troops indeed stood trial, the host’s dependence on the United States did not bias verdicts or sentences, since those were public. The data also show that the involvement of US troops in crime was far greater than previously known."
"I. A. Richards and Raymond Williams: Reading Poetry, Reading Society","How do people evaluate fairness of redistributive policies when redistribution is considered multidimensional? We estimate the effect of distributive policies on the top- and bottom-income groups, as well as the effects of general wealth, social mobility, and origin of wealth on people’s perceived fairness of the policies. Findings reveal that policies that encourage upward social mobility and an increase in general wealth and reward effort and upward mobility are seen as fair. Yet, what is seen as fair or unfair differs substantially across party and income groups. Policies that promote an increase of the status of the wealthiest, and policies that do not change or deteriorate the status of the poorest, generate different fairness perceptions. But there is room for agreement, as policies that make the poorest wealthier, while keeping the status of the wealthiest, are seen as fair by both Democrats and Republicans and among high- and low-income individuals."
Introduction,"Commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” in news coverage of the US education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as an object of study. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (n = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990 to 2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality."
At What Cost? Reexamining Audience Costs in Realistic Settings,"This article examines Berlin’s ascendance to the status of a global city and in particular the tethering of this discourse to the city’s attraction for institutions of world literature. Drawing on fieldwork between 2011 and 2017, it offers a new, critical vantage on the multiple trajectories that migrants follow into and through Berlin, as well as how these paths collide. Training ethnographic attention on one important site in which these crossings occur—a literary workshop in a gentrified borough of the former East—reveals long-standing assumptions about the social lives of texts and urban relationships, in which ephemeral forms are understood to be degraded or weak. Mobilizing instead a poetic language of prosody allows us to see how different kinds of circulations are stitched together in the making of everyday life."
"Medical Cultures, Therapeutic Properties, and Laws in Global History","This paper is based on a 16-year-long ethnography of mass grave exhumations in contemporary Spain and deals with the tortuous, painful, much-disputed, and incomplete unmaking of a concrete and massive militaristic inscription of Spain: that related to its last internal war (1936–1939) and subsequent dictatorship (1939–1975). To understand this process and its historical roots, the paper first dissects the formation of a “funerary apartheid” in the country since the end of the war. Second, it analyzes the impact on the social fabric of the mass grave exhumations of Republican civilians that started in the year 2000. Third, it traces how these disinterments have intersected with Spain’s most prominent Francoist stronghold, the Valley of the Fallen, and threaten the dictator’s burial place. Finally, it discusses the parallel dismantling of the dictatorship’s official statuary that once presided over prominent public spaces in many cities and some military quarters. It argues that rolling back militarization by dismantling war-derived cartographies of death, challenging military burial arrangements, or degrading statues of generals necessarily involves a certain level of remilitarizing by other means. I call this mirroring and deeply embodied memorial backfiring “phantom militarism.”"
Religious Invocations on Umayyad Lead Seals: Evidence of an Emergent Islamic Lexicon,"The Salvation Army has been an advocate of temperance since it was founded in 1865 and has been committed to total abstinence from intoxicating liquor since 1877. In the 1890s it was described as “a universal Anti-Drink Army.” However, it has been largely absent from most histories of the temperance movement in Britain. This article analyzes the historical development of The Salvation Army’s commitment to total abstinence, which grew out of the beliefs of its founders, William and Catherine Booth. Drawing on the Booths’ correspondence from the 1850s, the article will explore their differing stances on alcohol and will examine how Catherine’s views in particular came to be adopted by The Salvation Army, marked by a condemnation of moderate drinkers, fierce attacks on the drink trade, and a commitment to teetotalism as an essential part of Christian belief. The commitment to total abstinence led The Salvation Army to purchase several public houses for use as “temperance hotels” and to manufacture an alcohol-free “Booth’s Beer.” The article will look at these and other fronts opened by The Salvation Army in their “war on drink.”"
Facing US Extraterritorial Pressure: American Troops in Foreign Courts during the Cold War,"Nizan Shaked traces the interventions of Sonia Boyce's work in received categories of artistic practice, considering how these interventions suggest means of classification beyond media, artistic intention and identity."
"21 July 1773: Disputation, Poetry, Slavery",This article uses Tocqueville’s analysis of the religious impulse in the human soul to suggest one contributing factor to the rise of Far Right nationalism in America today. Many of those who find themselves attracted to the so-called Alt Right claim to be motivated by the desire for a commitment to a transcendent and morally demanding community but for various reasons are not satisfied by the more obviously religious alternative. I support this suggestion with selected engagement with self-described Alt Right authors.
"“The Hired Enemies of This Population”: Black New York, the NYPD, and the Fundamental Anti-Blackness of American Criminal Punishment","We examine public attitudes concerning a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). We hypothesize that citizens tend to display lower levels of support for investigations in their own country than hypothetical ones abroad. We further argue that this decrease in support is moderated by a citizen’s “proximity” to the investigation. Both perpetrators and victims of alleged crimes can be hesitant about legal interventions, with the former fearing prosecution and the latter fearing the loss of a fragile peace. We use a survey experiment about the ICC in Kyrgyzstan that randomly assigned respondents to a control group, asked about foreign investigations, and a treatment group, asked about an investigation into recent local violence. Treatment lowered otherwise relatively high approval for investigations. This effect was strongest in regions most proximate to the violence, especially among coethnics of victims. Our findings help explain why support for international law can vary widely across subnational constituencies."
Introduction: Literature and Migration,"AbstractThis article explores the conflicts between people and Atta leafcutter ants over the meaning of anthropogenic deforestation in nineteenth-century Brazil. As human agricultural settlement advanced, ants followed in its wake, harvesting leaves, flowers, fruits, and other plant parts from crops to supply their underground fungus gardens. In so doing, the ants, as semiotic selves, interpreted what humans had done and acted accordingly, producing historically consequential environmental change in the process. An examination of primary sources such as legislation, travel journals, agricultural manuals, government administrative documentation, and newspapers for human-ant conversations demonstrates how interspecies sense making has fueled social innovations and rearrangements, shaping technical developments, legal-administrative practices, parliamentary discussions, and even local electoral arenas. By taking written documents as surviving structures of embodied, more-than-symbolic conversations, this analysis both takes its cue from, and helps substantiate, what Ewa Domanska has termed a “multispecies co-authorship” approach to human-animal relations. It argues that such a theoretical-methodological stance helps environmental historians account for nonhuman agency by allowing the exploration of animals’ truly creative, rather than merely resistive, behavior."
How Fair Is It? An Experimental Study of Perceived Fairness of Distributive Policies,"AbstractThe late twentieth-century American South hosted a thriving lakefront development industry. The arrival of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla in reservoirs across the region during the 1970s threatened this Sunbelt prosperity. Unwilling to watch their investments become choked by a mat of floating vegetation, Texas developers pushed the state to introduce the white amur, an exotic and voracious Manchurian fish to control hydrilla. The resulting hearings and scientific studies, however, did as much to perpetuate uncertainty as to provide consensus. This failure of expertise opened space for developers to convince the legislature to back their interests. Doubt became the means by which they justified the use of biological control to protect their investments. Drawing on the work of Ulrich Beck and Rachel Carson, this account of hydrilla and the white amur reveals the pervasiveness of risk, the flexibility of biological control, and the power of development imperatives in the state-level management of a globalized reservoir."
On Cooperationism: An End to the Economic Plague,"Marx’s vision of unalienated production is often thought to be subject to decisive objections. This article argues that these objections rely on a misinterpretation of Marx’s position. It provides a new interpretation of Marx’s vision of unalienated production. Unlike another well-known account, it suggests that unalienated production involves realizing oneself through providing others with the goods and services they need for their self-realization. It argues that this view is appealing and that it offers a more successful response to objections than previous interpretations. In doing so, it hopes to put Marx’s concern with alienation and nonalienation back on the table."
Genres of Desire: The Erotic in Deobandī Islam,"I argue for the importance of considering author, director, and producer Michael Crichton (1942–2008) as a critic and student of Cold War cultures of expertise. Though best known for his blockbuster fiction, he shared a sensibility with academics in North America and the United Kingdom who were concerned with scientists’ unchecked authority. These scholars created a new field that would later become known as Science and Technology Studies or STS. Like his contemporaries in STS, and often in anticipation of them, Crichton’s novels relied on a blend of history, sociology, and anthropology to lift back the curtain to reveal the specialized worlds in which scientists worked, and to devote specific attention to the practices, instruments, and values that animated their knowledge-production enterprise. In doing so, his fiction both popularized STS and shaped concerns and fears about the future of science and technology. The “speculative present” is useful for making visible the ironies exploited by Crichton, including his own engagement with ideas about speculation as both a form of conjecture and a form of prospecting value. Inspired by Donna Haraway’s early work on the cyborg, the speculative present helps to pry open forms of world making obscured by adherence to binaries of fact and fiction, nature and culture, with the goal of cultivating a broader array of visions about emerging science and technology."
The “Discourse of Derision” in News Coverage of Education: A Mixed Methods Analysis of an Emerging Frame,"On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, murdered George Perry Floyd Jr., and protests erupted in cities and towns across the country. The public health threat of anti-Black police violence in the wake of the pandemic and, more directly, Floyd’s murder led many to describe “twin pandemics” of COVID-19 and racism, a framing that circulated widely. As the analysis emerging from the Black Lives Matter movement has made clear, these are not separate threats: the disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates in communities of color clearly manifest the structural racism that is, in turn, foundational for public health disasters. It is not surprising that women-of-color feminism has laid the groundwork for an analysis emerging from a movement inaugurated by three Black women. Our essay builds on that work to explore an emerging vocabulary these insights have generated: the adoption of phrases such as “systemic racism” and “white supremacy” as the lingua franca of mainstream media, which has gone largely unremarked, as well as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s redefinition of “racism.” We argue for the importance of a changing vocabulary that at once registers and facilitates efforts to address structural racism and the violence it perpetuates."
“Better to Die by Them than for Them”: Carl Schmitt Reads “Benito Cereno”,"Scholarship has largely ignored A Mirror for Magistrates (1559), and specifically its prose frame, because of the shamelessly unrealistic composition process it depicts. According to these prose pieces, the Mirror’s authors pretend to be fifteenth-century figures whose complaints they then record in the space of twenty-four hours. Passing over the Mirror’s fictionalized origins, however, obscures how its frame narrative transforms the act of writing historical verse tragedies into a performative, and problematically avant-garde, experience for the Mirror’s writers and readers. The Mirror’s prose frame enables its contributors to turn historical play-acting into an innovative methodology for experiencing the past in the present. The dramatized complaint poems require the Mirror’s authors to take on the stories, personalities, voices, and (imaginatively) mutilated bodies of past people; therefore, the prose frame invents a performative model of history, in which the past can be made emotionally and physically present. Changes in the Mirror’s second edition (1563) evidence a discomfort with and fear of the very encounters with history that this methodology enables. This affective reaction leads the Mirror authors to abandon a form of performative history that the following generation of English writers and playwrights deliberately seek out. [M.L.]"
“With much labour out of scattered papers”: The Caroline Reprints of Thomas Heywood’s 1 and 2 If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody,"This essay examines public artworks by Jari “WERC” Alvarez and Geraldine “Gera” Lozano in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. It theorizes “bricozaje,” a concept that combines the terms “bricolage” and “mestizaje,” to argue that the artists enact a reparative relationship to the works’ sites through their use of imagery. The essay first looks at Alvarez’s and Lozano’s sketchbooks to trace bricozaje’s valences as a material practice and critique of bricolage. It proceeds to examine bricozaje as a collaborative practice through the creation of La Entrada (2009), a mural project in San Diego. It then contextualizes the public art project Bright Women (2011) in relation to representations of the US-Mexico border, and concludes by articulating how bricozaje acts as a formal strategy through Lozano’s engagement with gendered iconography."
The Prosody of Social Ties: Poetry and Fleeting Moments in Global Berlin,"During the Second World War, the Graphics Division of the Office of War Information played a crucial role in the development of visual propaganda in American culture. Revisiting this period and in particular the poster art of Ben Shahn, this article explores his work in the larger context of searching for a democratic propaganda vis-à-vis totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia. Shahn included references to mass media, repurposed photographs, and explored depictions of violence, for example, in a series called The Nature of the Enemy. His work at the Graphics Division, produced in close collaboration with other artists, thus reflected on the challenges of finding appropriate new forms of pictorialism for the horrific narratives of atrocities coming out of Europe. I argue that it introduced modernist elements of reflexivity that made his posters sophisticated, but also challenging and controversial. Ultimately, I contend that these war posters reflect a struggle to create a visual rhetoric that negotiates the domestic and international implications of warfare, while aiming to project an inclusive, universalist vision of humanity."
Stare Decisis—Rhetoric and Reality in the Supreme Court,"African American interest and presence in Australia during the Pacific War was a significant if largely forgotten aspect of a conflict in which racial and colonial issues loomed large. Linking domestic and international manifestations of white supremacy, Black leaders compared Australian racism to segregationist practices in the American South and elsewhere. Arguing that the White Australia Policy contradicted the democratic principles for which the United States and its allies claimed to be fighting, they condemned Australia as a “bulwark of white supremacy.” Yet, the African American critique of White Australia was marked by contradictions, as Black Americans betrayed an underlying acceptance of many of the civilizationist assumptions embedded in European colonialism—including in Britain’s White dominions. By examining this neglected aspect of the twentieth-century transnational struggle against racism and colonialism and exploring the complex intersection of race, nationality, and class that shaped the struggle, this article develops our understandings of the emerging contest against white supremacy that was provoked by global war and the rising tide of anticolonialism that transformed the postwar world."
"Unburials, Generals, and Phantom Militarism: Engaging with the Spanish Civil War Legacy","Karma and grace are grammars for material and moral being, each offering onto-cosmological justification for the vicissitudes of destiny. Beyond their scriptural renderings, karma and grace are vernacular cosmologies, which in Sri Lanka, are engaged as repertoires of judgment, reckoning, and discernment of causes of fortune and misfortune. This paper ventures to compare and contrast karma and grace. It queries the agonistic intersection between evangelical imperatives towards Christian proselytism and conversion, and nationalistic imperatives to maintain the Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka. Pentecostal-charismatic Christians extol conversion as discontinuity, which rests upon surrender to grace. Dedicated Buddhists, in contrast, consider one’s life-conditions as righteously inherited through a karmically-governed cosmos, and thus place great value upon religio-moral continuity. In agonistic interchanges between Buddhist nationalists and Christian evangelists in Sri Lanka, we see how karma and grace may be seen as constituting two competing economies of religious belonging."
“The Fatal Gaze of This Moral Basilisk”: The Salvation Army’s War on Drink in Victorian Britain,"Using newly uncovered archival sources, this essay traces the meteoric rise and fall of the peculiar interdisciplinary German scientific journal Physis, founded by the physicist Pascual Jordan and the biologist Adolf Meyer-Abich in 1941. Launched when victory for Nazi Germany seemed certain, Physis was intended by Jordan and Meyer-Abich to be a premier international journal for all sciences suitable for the new “German-led Europe” forged by conquest. Yet the journal was simultaneously a vehicle for institutionalizing Jordan’s remarkably prescient vision of the future of the scientific enterprise in Hitler’s state—a vision nearly identical to what is now termed “big science,” yet suitably “Nazified” for wartime Germany. Behind the scenes, Physis was accompanied by a campaign of intrigue, through which Jordan and Meyer-Abich hoped to find a patron for the journal and big science among the various power centers of the Nazi state. These efforts failed, yet they nevertheless demonstrate that big science is not inherently democratic."
Sonia Boyce: Reclassifying Classification,"Work on candidate positioning suggests that ambiguous statements help candidates by broadening their appeal and providing leeway to take different positions once in office. While experimental research has explored the electoral effects posited by the first, empirical testing of the second is lacking. As such, we use two original survey experiments (a national sample and a convenience sample) to show that contrary to conventional wisdom, ambiguity may not shield a legislator from the backlash that comes from eventually taking a position with which voters disagree. In addition, we find that a candidate’s rhetorical strategy matters most for social and cultural issues that represent core beliefs and values. In sum, our work makes important advances in the study of the longer-term effects of campaign rhetoric and suggests that if an issue cannot be avoided, there may be little to gain from attempting to obscure one’s intended position."
Dirk van Delft; Ton van Helvoort. Beelden zonder weerga: De elektronenmicroscoop van Ernst Ruska tot Ben Feringa.,"There are striking differences in inequality and redistribution between the United States and Scandinavia. To study whether there are corresponding differences in social preferences, we conducted a large-scale international social preference experiment where Americans and Norwegians make distributive choices in identical environments. Combining the infrastructure of an international online labor market and that of a leading international data collection agency, we show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. We also provide causal evidence suggesting that fairness considerations are more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations."
The Alt Right and the Religious Impulse: A Tocquevillian Analysis,"AbstractRachel Carson’s Silent Spring is justly remembered as a landmark in the history of modern environmentalism. It is, however, a more complicated text than cultural memory tends to acknowledge. Blending conservative and traditional elements with more progressive and pioneering ones, Silent Spring is marked by a complexity that extends to its reception and legacy. This article argues that—in a seeming paradox—it was the more conservative elements of Silent Spring that allowed it to be considered a revolutionary book. Carson carefully constructed her argument in ways that facilitated its initial acceptance. But those same decisions made it easier for supporters to de-emphasize its more radical implications, even as they granted it revolutionary status."
Public Reactions to International Legal Institutions: The International Criminal Court in a Developing Democracy,"Immanuel Kant viewed economic interdependence among nations as the catalyst for a cosmopolitan legal order. Some of the most advanced international institutions in existence today facilitate such interdependence. Are bodies such as the European Union, World Trade Organization, and North American Free Trade Agreement the harbingers of Kantian cosmopolitan right? This article contends that the commercial motif in Kant’s thought deserves greater scrutiny than it has so far received, particularly since it has encouraged some to summon Kant’s authority in advocating global economic liberalization, while leading others to attack the cosmopolitan project as a smokescreen for neoliberalism. Maneuvering Kantian cosmopolitanism out of this double bind requires placing renewed emphasis on constitutional states as the building blocks of a cosmopolitan order and paying greater attention to the conditions of legitimacy that supranational institutions must meet in order to claim the cosmopolitan mantle. Cosmopolitanism is not exclusively supranational, and supranational institutions are not necessarily cosmopolitan."
A Recursive Measure of Voting Power with Partial Decisiveness or Efficacy,This note examines how a traditional model of emperorship found in Pliny’s Panegyricus (Plin. Pan. 22–24) was used in praising fourth-century imperial leadership. It focuses in particular on the notion of the emperor moving on foot. The first section deals with Pacatus’ speech in praise of Theodosius (Pan. Lat. 2.47) and shows how and why “the walking emperor” was revived. The second section contrasts Mamertinus’ speech to Julian (Pan. Lat. 3.29–30) with Ammianus’ account of Constantius II (Amm. Marc. 16.10) in order to highlight the constraints that were attached to the notion of “the walking emperor.”
Meaningful Clearings: Human-Ant Negotiated Landscapes in Nineteenth-Century Brazil,"This article traces the history of concerted black resistance to the film Gone with the Wind, whose popularity I argue was contingent on its expression of white nationalist pro-Confederate, pro-slaveholder Lost Cause mythology. By centering the voices of the resistance, this article offers a corrective to previous scholarship that fails to grasp the resistance’s significance or frames it as merely provoked by the offensive nature of the film’s racist imagery and language. Instead, at the heart of the protest was the danger that the film’s mythology posed to black communities if it became entrenched in white national historical consciousness. Activists were correct about the film’s ideological impact, and their protests wielded real influence, altering the film’s final product to be less overtly racist. However, failing to stop Gone with the Wind, while muting its most racist components, contributed to the film’s incredible popularity and its longevity."
"Risk, Doubt, and the Biological Control of Southern Waters","We develop a model of electoral accountability with mainstream and alternative media. In addition to regular high- and low-competence types, the incumbent may be an aspiring autocrat who controls the mainstream media and will subvert democracy if retained in office. A truthful alternative media can help voters identify and remove these subversive types while reelecting competent leaders. A malicious alternative media, in contrast, spreads false accusations about the incumbent and demotivates policy effort. If the alternative media is very likely to be malicious and hence is unreliable, voters ignore it and use only the mainstream media to hold regular incumbents accountable, leaving aspiring autocrats to win reelection via propaganda that portrays them as effective policy makers. When the alternative media’s reliability is intermediate, voters heed its warnings about subversive incumbents, but the prospect of being falsely accused demotivates effort by regular incumbents and electoral accountability breaks down."
Arunabh Ghosh. Making It Count: Statistics and Statecraft in the Early People’s Republic of China.,"Citizens are, on average, too pessimistic when assessing the trajectory of current crime trends. In this study, we examine whether we can correct this perceptual bias with respect to burglaries. Using a field experiment coupled with a large panel survey (n=4,895), we explore whether a public information campaign can reduce misperceptions about the prevalence of burglaries. Embedding the correct information about burglary rates in a direct mail campaign, we find that it is possible to substantially reduce citizens’ misperceptions. Importantly, the effects are not short-lived: they are detectable several weeks after the mailer was sent, but they are temporary and eventually the perceptual bias reemerges. Our results suggest that if citizens were continually supplied with correct information about crime rates they would be less pessimistic. Reducing bias in citizens’ perception of crime rates might therefore be a matter of adjusting the supply of (dis)information about crime."
The Importance of Others: Marx on Unalienated Production,"As the chief litigator for the US government, the solicitor general plays a crucial role in the Supreme Court decision-making process. The justices and solicitor general share a mutually beneficial relationship that is reinforced by the solicitor general’s willingness to provide legal advice when asked. In this article, we examine whether and how this relationship changes when the solicitor general files a formal “confession of error.” Using data on confessions filed between the 1979 and 2014 terms, we find the justices are significantly less likely to support the solicitor general’s position at multiple stages of the Court’s decision-making process if the solicitor general confesses error in light of a policy change. This punishment is harshest when the solicitor general provides advice as an amicus curiae participant, but it is only temporary. These results provide new insight into the scope and limitations of benefits allotted to the Court’s “tenth justice.”"
The Speculative Present: How Michael Crichton Colonized the Future of Science and Technology,"Among presidents’ lesser known legislative powers is urgency authority. Seven Latin American presidents wield it: the constitutional power to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote selected bills. This power is similar to the fast-track authority that Congress grants periodically to the US president. We claim that the key consequence of urgency authority is procedural: urgency prevents amendments during floor consideration. By using fast-track authority, presidents can protect bills and committee agreements, in essence becoming a single-member Rules Committee with the ability to impose closed rules on the floor. A formal model generates hypotheses that we test with original data from Chile between 1998 and 2014. Results confirm that preference overlap between the president and committee chairs drives the use of fast-track authority systematically. Patterns in Chile are reminiscent of restrictive rule usage in the United States."
COVID-19 and the Language of Racism,"What strategies are behind major powers’ decisions to deploy forces abroad? We argue that major powers use noninvasion troop deployments to create, consolidate, and expand their spheres of influence around the world, while at the same time trying to prevent their major power rivals from doing the same. This results in an action-reaction process, in which each additional major power troop placement happens as a strategic response to recent and anticipated placements by others. This theoretical framework leads us to expect temporal and regional clustering in troop deployments by allied and rival major powers. We test our expectations using data on troop deployments and a local structure graph model, a network estimator that allows for modeling each troop placement as a function of other deployments, weighted by ideological similarity. Our results provide evidence for our hypotheses."
Religious Approaches to Milton,"The nave paintings at the monastery of St. Anthony were executed by local artists in the           early thirteenth century, during a period of mounting concerns over the Arabization and           Islamization of the Coptic community. The cycle, which depicts thirty-one images of           military martyrs and monastic saints, stands out from contemporary programs owing to its           structure and its inclusion of rarely depicted hagiographic episodes. The program           juxtaposes early Christian martyrs and the great Desert Fathers of Egypt, demonstrating a           preoccupation with sacred ancestry and lineage. Within the martyr cycle, the preponderance           of warrior saints shown violently slaying traditional enemies of the faith (pagans,           heretics, and a Jew) is striking, as most of these refer to miracles that have no textual           analogue. To some extent, the presence of warrior saints can be explained within a local           devotional context, in which the paintings served as the liturgical backdrop for a           monastic community that regarded itself as the heir to the community founded by St.           Anthony, who engaged in spiritual combat at the site where the monastery was constructed.           Lost in this interpretation is how the images might relate to broader religious debates in           the Islamic period. This study engages with a little-known corpus of Arab Christian texts           and recent scholarship on the religious history of Egypt. I argue that the unusually           violent iconography reveals an awareness of Islamic historiographic narratives and should           be understood in light of east Christian hagiographic and polemical texts then circulating           in Egypt. Stories in these works are characteristically structured to draw out           similarities between Christianity and Islam as a step toward staking out exclusive claims           to religious truth and Christian preeminence. The unusual cycle provides evidence of how           Coptic Christians employed paintings to fortify the faith."
Affective History in A Mirror for Magistrates: Embodied Encounters and Performative Pasts,"In the years between 1967 and 1970, Philip Guston scandalized the New York art world by renouncing abstraction and turning instead to figurative modes of painting characterized by cartoonish images that mixed Ku Klux Klan hoods, idioms of popular culture, and a private vocabulary of cigars, light bulbs, legs, shoes and other assorted—and often hairy—body parts. Buried within these often outlandish works are three recurring concerns: questions of pilgrimage, revelation, and epiphany that link Guston to Hudson River School painting of the nineteenth century; a covert interest in writing as a cultural logic that informs his own painting practices; and an obsessive focus on lines that distinguishes Guston’s art from the drips and gestural forms of Jackson Pollock. Ultimately, each of these concerns points to what I take to be the real—and unspoken—focus of Guston’s figurative work: the history and memory of the Holocaust."
The Elephant in the Room: Intentional Voter Suppression,"Previous research has described the criminal justice system as a “labor market institution.” In recent years, however, research on the relationship between the criminal justice system and the labor market has focused primarily on the negative impact of criminal justice involvement on an individual’s ability to find work postrelease. This article explores how workers’ exposure to the criminal justice system is related to labor organization—a labor market institution through which workers in the United States have secured benefits for themselves and that, structurally, has mitigated income inequality. Across three analyses, we find a negative relationship between exposure to the criminal justice system and involvement in labor organizations. In a fourth analysis, we find evidence that this relationship results from employers’ increased power over those so exposed. Mass incarceration may discipline low-wage workers by decreasing their likelihood of participating in organizations through which they might gain economic power individually and collectively."
On the Virtues of Historical Entomophagy,"War makes states and states make war. However, state building to mediate among science, technological innovation, and warfare is very different from state building to mobilize people, revenue, science, and industry for war. Where the latter prizes autonomy, authority, and planning, the former values experimentation and learning across plural modalities of practice. This article explains the difference between mobilization and mediation; provides a theory of state building for mediation in wartime and applies that theory to the case of the United States’ Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG) in World War II. ASWORG was born into a crisis in the Atlantic that divided scientists and soldiers, and yet also made them need each other. The U.S. War Department tried to overcome the conflict with techniques designed for mobilization, and it failed. While historical institutionalism can explain why it failed, it cannot explain how ASWORG successfully mediated science and warfare. Drawing on actor-network theory and theories of emergent institutions, and inspired by pragmatism and complexity theory, I explain how scientists and soldiers in ASWORG learned through joint reflection to mediate the incommensurable practices of science and warfare in ways that neither could predict. They transposed techniques from physics to warfare in operations research; recomposed operations research from a scientific control system to a monitoring system that facilitated mutual learning; recombined defensive and offensive military tactics; and circulated themselves between the factory, the laboratory, and the battlefield to speed the adjustment of new technologies and military tactics."
Raw Power and the Occult: A Review,"Purpose: Drawing on relevant literature, we conceptualize three pathways through which responsiveness to student voice may promote academic goals. Then, we analyze panel data of students in the Chicago Public Schools to examine this relationship. We focus on the “responsiveness” of teachers and administrators to student voice, because prior work has highlighted that opportunities for student voice are often symbolic. Our central goal is to examine whether responsiveness to student voice is related to academic outcomes. Research Methods/Approach: We draw upon student records collected in Chicago Public Schools from the 2017–18 and 2018–19 school years, as well as students’ responses to questions administered in the district’s 2019 5Essentials Survey. We estimate models of the effect of responsiveness to student voice on students’ ninth-grade academic outcomes, controlling for students’ eighth-grade attendance and grade point average. Findings: In schools that students regard as responsive to their expressed critiques, students have better grades and attendance and reduced rates of chronic absenteeism. This is the first large-scale study employing panel data to examine the relationships between responsiveness to student voice and academic performance. Implications: Proponents of student voice have long emphasized its benefits in terms of democratic values and respect for the full humanity of young people. Scholars argue these benefits may be particularly important for students from marginalized communities. This study indicates that there are academic benefits as well. However, future studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which responsiveness to student voice yields valued benefits."
Bricozaje: Between Contested Terrains and Aesthetic Borderlands,"May Rosenthal Sloan explores the culinary works of Cooking Sections, whose research in questions of ecology, capital and power culminates in transformative interventions."
Nathaniel Price: The Life and Work of a Sometime Blind Bookbinder,"AbstractIn the mid-2000s, Bolivia emerged as a leader in sustainable tropical forestry, in large part because of Ley 1700, the 1996 forestry law. The 1996 forestry law reformed Bolivian forestry by requiring management plans, inventories, and harvest limits while also guaranteeing the legal right of Indigenous communities to manage their forests for timber. This article analyzes the history of Bolivian forestry reforms, paying particular attention to the involvement of Indigenous lowland communities in influencing the forestry law. Specifically, we analyze the role a 1990 Indigenous protest march called the March for Territory and Dignity had in unifying Indigenous communities, incorporating Indigenous concepts of territory into the national dialogue and legal framework, and influencing the 1996 forestry law. We argue that the Indigenous protest march united Indigenous communities around the common cause of territorial sovereignty. In response to Indigenous protest, the Bolivian government established Indigenous-controlled territories and enacted forestry reforms that incorporated community demands and values."
Troubling (Post)colonial Histories of Medicine: Toward a Praxis of the Human,"This article explores the interpretive and divinatory practices and strategies used in the South African street-based lottery game fafi. The game, run by the Chinese community in South Africa and played predominantly by low-income black South Africans, utilizes a set of images and divinatory practices, particularly dream interpretation. The article analyzes the practices and history of fafi, alongside the financial and interpretive stakes of the gambling game, to understand contemporary orientations towards the future and uncertainty. Dreaming—learning how to dream and how to interpret dream images—as a gambling skill is understood in relation to traditional healing and diagnostic practices in South Africa. In the context of shifting urban landscapes, the piece argues that “the future” has become an entity to get ahead of rather than a projected goal or destination one hopes for."
"Piccarda’s Weakness: Reflections on Freedom, Force, and Femininity in Dante’s Paradiso","The standard view of academic freedom and free speech is that they play complementary roles in universities. Academic freedom protects academic discourse, while other public discourse in universities is protected by free speech. Here I challenge this view, broadly, on the grounds that free speech in universities sometimes undermines academic practices. One defense of the standard view, in the face of this worry, says that campus free speech actually furthers the university’s academic aims. Another says that universities have a secondary democratic function, which cannot be fulfilled without free speech on campus. I identify shortcomings in both types of arguments."
Fighting for a Free World: Ben Shahn and the Art of the War Poster,"Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge, without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus, this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective positions."
"Confronting the “Bulwark of White Supremacy”: The African American Challenge to White Australia, 1941–1945","AbstractWhat goes up must come down—the adage about gravity applies to baseballs and spacecraft alike. Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, thousands of space artifacts have fallen to Earth in an event known as “reentry.” Although most disappear from view, dissipating in the atmosphere or falling into the sea, on occasion a piece of so-called “space junk” will survive the fall and land on terra firma, typically far from its nation of origin. During the long 1970s, a confluence of natural and anthropogenic forces pushed large pieces of hardware out of orbit and back to Earth. These events collapsed geographical boundaries and brought far-flung states, communities, and environments on either side of the Iron Curtain into dangerous proximity. When space junk fell where it should not, cultural and linguistic translation and the influence of a truly global natural environment subject to its own arcane geophysical laws complicated untested international liability and governance regimes. The history of space junk reentries—particularly the 1978 “nuclear reentry” of the Cosmos 954 satellite—demonstrates how the nearest regions of outer space became an uncooperative geopolitical actor in a new form of envirotechnical emergency during the Cold War. Like other extreme environments such as polar regions and oceans, I argue that outer space merits scholarly attention as a significant natural force in human history. Contrary to triumphal spaceflight narratives, I also argue that the Space Age became truly global not solely through acts of innovation but also in moments of decay."
Karma and grace: Rivalrous reckonings of fortune and misfortune,"Militarism and militarization have inspired opposition for millennia. In the post–World War II era, dozens of social movements challenging the existence and operation of US and other foreign (extraterritorial) military bases have provided a prominent example of antimilitarization activism. Movements from Okinawa, Japan, and Jeju, South Korea, to Vieques, Puerto Rico, and Vicenza, Italy, have struggled to close existing bases, stop the construction of new bases, and reduce or eliminate the harms that bases frequently inflict on local communities. This article reviews the history and effects of antibase movements, including recent efforts to create a global “No Bases” movement. While these movements have achieved varying degrees of success and had complicated impacts at individual, local, national, and global scales, this article shows that antibase movements collectively have been important actors in international geopolitics, with significant global influence. Specifically, movements have disrupted everyday military operations and reshaped the global deployment of US bases abroad. Antibase movements thus provide an example of how antimilitarization movements can check, slow, and in some cases reverse militarization—although militarization can continue after base closures. The article concludes with seven tentative hypotheses explaining why some antibase movements are more successful than others in achieving their stated aims."
"Big Science, Nazified? Pascual Jordan, Adolf Meyer-Abich, and the Abortive Scientific Journal Physis","Biographical studies of Althea Gibson, the first African American to compete and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association’s National Championship at Forest Hills, maintain that the Black media maligned her because of her reluctance to be an activist-athlete. This article argues that journalists disparaged Gibson for living a broadly queer life suggestive of lesbianism during the concurrent Cold War and Civil Rights Movement. Unmarried, a sportswoman, and career-oriented, Gibson sometimes dressed and expressed herself in ways that society deemed masculine and that her critics viewed as incompatible with race womanhood. By scrutinizing Gibson’s body, behavior, and life choices, these figures communicated the parameters of racial representation for Black sportswomen, specifically that heteronormativity and aesthetics were as important as athletic achievements for consideration as a race woman. Undaunted, Gibson veered from racialized gender norms and challenged black patriarchy as much as white supremacy."
"Reflection, Refraction, Revolution: The “Colouring of Imagination”",Danielle Child examines the extent to which artists' proposals for alternative contemporary economies successfully revive the historical avant-garde project of returning art to the praxis of life.
Ambiguous Rhetoric and Legislative Accountability,"This note proposes new interpretations of Hera’s bribe offered in Cratinus’ Dionysalexandros. While Hera’s τυραννὶς ἀκίνητος is usually interpreted as an offer of permanent demagoguery in light of the play’s mockery of Pericles, I argue that τυραννíς also recalls contemporary debates about the Athenian empire and that ἀκίνητος puns on the obscene meaning of κινεῖν."
New Directions in African American Sports History: A Field of One’s Own,"Criminal record checks have become a widely used method for governing access to institutional attachments in the United States. State laws that authorize or require the use of background checks serve as one important source of criminal records’ expanded reach. The current study uses novel longitudinal data to examine the proliferation of these laws at the state level between 1982 and 2013. Panel analyses provide the strongest support for a model of racial classification, with the rate of background check adoption increasing as African-Americans represent larger shares of state criminal record populations. Considerable support is also found for racial economic threat and, to a lesser extent, ethnic economic threat. Background check adoption is only weakly associated with violent crime rates and other features of state-level penal regimes."
Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans More Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?,"Although costs of trade disruption play a central role in theories of interstate conflict, scholars have had difficulty in constructing appropriate measures of trade wars, and few have explored how states can mitigate the resulting costs, reducing vulnerability to economic coercion. We study these questions in the context of economic sanctions, arguing that each side’s comparative advantage in exports and domestic production capabilities determine its ability to minimize costs while maximizing its power to hurt the adversary. We find support for our hypotheses, using commodity-level trade data. Sanctions are more likely to succeed when sanctioners have a comparative advantage in goods exported to the target, but more likely to fail if the target’s export portfolio is diverse or the target has a comparative advantage in exports. This is particularly true for imposed sanctions. These findings open the black box of sanction costs, improving our understanding of when economic coercion succeeds."
Rachel Carson and the Rhetoric of Revolution,"Philology haunts the humanities, through both its defendants and its detractors. This article examines the construction of philology as the premier science of the long nineteenth century in Europe. It aims to bring the history of philology up to date by taking it seriously as a science and giving it the kind of treatment that has dominated the history of science for the last generation: to reveal how practices, instruments, and cooperation create visions of timeless knowledge. This historical inquiry therefore asks how one modality of textual interpretation could morph into an integrated system of knowledge production, which ostensibly explained the whole human world. Ultimately, it advances a central argument: philology operated as a relational network, one that concealed diversity and disunity, projected unity and stability, and seemed to rise above the material conditions of its own making. The article scrutinizes the composition of philology as a heterogeneous ensemble, the functioning of philology comparable to other sciences, whether human or natural, and the historical contingency in the articulation of philology."
"Propagate Autonomy: On Jonas Staal, Captain America and Willi Münzenberg","In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century."
What Future?,"This article explores the emergence of a selfhood organized around the experience of drug addiction in 1930s Britain, taking as its focus the autobiographical writings of the aristocratic “society” drug addict Brenda Dean Paul. It details the various discourses deployed by Dean Paul in her process of self-fashioning, and so builds on recent work demonstrating the agency exercised by addicts in the face of proliferating systems of control constructed in these years by illustrating their simultaneous discursive agency. In addition, the study offers a new perspective on the relationship between class and culture in interwar Britain. In contrast to other accounts that explore how the critique of popular culture offered by upper-class commentators served to reinforce social hierarchies, this article demonstrates how, in other hands, popular culture provided a vehicle for bridging the gulf between classes."
Cosmopolitanism and International Economic Institutions,"History reveals enemies often ally to confront a common threat. In such competitive coalitions actors must balance the simultaneous risk of distrust of their ally against external danger. We model this interactive relationship and generate several novel outcomes. Intra-alliance rivalry forces allying players to preemptively commit more resources to conflict and to free ride less. Consequently, their likelihood of conflict success increases. However, intra-alliance instability forces weaker players to commit a higher proportion of resources to fighting than do their stronger allies. This outcome runs contrary to Mancur Olson’s classic collective action result that the “small exploit the great.” Furthermore, allies do not demonstrate a uniform preference for bandwagoning or balancing. In general, it is preferable to bandwagon with friends but to balance with enemies. Finally, because rivalry can raise alliance payoffs, actors may rationally seek out risky partnerships with so-called enemies rather than molding more certain alliances with friends."
Following in the Footsteps of Trajan: A Note on Traditional Emperorship in Late Fourth-Century Panegyric,"Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become “immigrationized,” or formed on the basis of people’s feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants’ use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link."
"Burnham, Popular Science, and Popularization","In the 1980s, Indigenous Aboriginal women in Australia began to agitate against liquor outlets perceived as affecting the remote communities in which they lived, and mobilized in a series of fluid grassroots public demonstrations against alcohol availability. The women supported dry zones, local prohibition, and abstinence and were opposed to reforms designed to improve drinking places and promote “social” drinking. In these and many other ways, Aboriginal women’s activism and ideology resembled that of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Australia decades earlier, despite there being no direct influence from the WCTU. This article explores the commonalities in the tactics and strategies deployed by these “old” and “new” temperance movements and argues that for Aboriginal women, their dissent necessitated a complex negotiation around the social and cultural norms of their society."
"Protesting “a Bigger and Better Birth of a Nation”: Lost Causism and Black Resistance to David O. Selznick’s Gone with the Wind, 1936–1940","A recently rediscovered record from late medieval England shines light on the discomfort which arose from the expansion of royal bureaucracy to promote and maintain regional aquatic infrastructure. The record contains the proceedings of a 1396 inquest made by a commission of sewers to investigate claims of clogged drainage canals and consequent flooding of farmland. For the late medieval Sussex landowners named in the record, the commission purportedly represented an unwanted incursion, a violation of traditional rights and obligations. In contrast, for the government agents conducting the inquest, the encounter with local interests raised important questions about authority, precedent, and the limits of supposed tradition. Today, read through the lens of environmental history, this conflict underscores that the written records of medieval Europe, long a source of qualitative data, provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the symbiotic relationship between human culture—in this case law, tradition, agriculture, and infrastructure, and natural contexts."
"Propaganda, Alternative Media, and Accountability in Fragile Democracies","This article formalizes how extremists manipulate an ethnic or religious identity to generate intergroup tension in society. I argue that Islamic extremists seek to reinforce the Islamic identity of Muslims. To do so, they launch terror attacks against a majority non-Muslim population as a provocation strategy to trigger a backlash against Muslims. This backlash makes it more difficult for Muslims to assimilate, pulling them away from the mainstream and promoting their in-group solidarity. I find that this strategy of provocation succeeds only if Muslims manage to provide sufficient in-group favoritism to counteract the backlash. If the majority shuns unassimilated Muslims more, or if the Muslim community is more economically unproductive, it is easier to mobilize Muslims, and extremists can induce more Muslims to stop assimilating. Provocation efficacy increases if the government excludes the Muslim community and, surprisingly, decreases when the Muslim community is more extreme or more homogeneous."
